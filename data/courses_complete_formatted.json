Throughout the course of her 79 years, she rose from humble beginnings in South Carolina, the daughter of formerly enslaved parents, to work with presidents and world leaders. She was born during the period of Reconstruction, and passed away the same year as the ruling of Brown vs. Board of Education was made, which will allow for a study of her participation in laying the foundation for the Modern Civil Rights Movement. Students will also gain experiential learning by visiting historic sites which preserve the legacy of Bethune, including the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House-National Historic Site and the Carter G. Woodson Home-National Historic Site.",

The curriculum integrates theoretical and critical readings from Black Brazilian female intellectuals, intersecting with various mediums such as fiction, graphic novels, films, music, and visual arts.

After initial grounding in the study of technology, speculative art and literature, and speculative design, we will pivot to “labs” where you will be able to read and analyze Black speculative works, develop a Black speculative method based on these works, and apply that method to your design of a technological tool that addresses a social problem.",

The overriding question is, in the face of disappointing outcomes, tragedy and collapse, can the history of Black revolt and revolution still provide a framework for thinking about radical change in the 21st Century, or should we move beyond it?",

Characterized by scholars as neo-slave narratives and, later, post-neo slave narratives, contemporary fictions of US slavery deploy the formal features and thematic concerns of the slave narrative to reveal Black freedom dreams of later periods. Examining recent literary, filmic, and televisual representations of US slavery, this course foregrounds racial slavery in the establishment of longstanding socioeconomic and political asymmetries across race, gender, and class in the US. And it analyzes the ways in which imaginative depictions of racial slavery seek to address and ameliorate such asymmetries. Our class will pay particular attention to how contemporary Black writers and filmmakers thematize labor, love, gender, power, pleasure, community, and resistance among the enslaved and their descendants.",

This course will focus on two interrelated themes. The first is the implementation of immigration and nationality controls designed to manage cross-border traffic and restrict membership in the national community. The second is to explore how the projection of US power beyond its territorial borders (e.g. US empire) has fueled cross-border movement between metropole and colonial\/postcolonial zones. We will highlight the ways in which the US’s encroachment of borders outside its territorial domain raises important questions about the meaning and legitimacy of national sovereignty and the fashioning of immigrant “illegality.”",

This course explores different ways that society and culture create suffering, and ways that suffering shapes society and culture. This happens not just in suffering itself but also in ways that people try to overcome suffering. Therefore, we also consider the relationship of compassion, empathy and sympathy, and other forms of care to suffering, always paying close attention to questions of the unequal distributions of both suffering and compassion to different groups of people.",

We'll consider how language creates and reinforces social inequality and difference, how language promotes and resists globalization, and how language is used creatively in performance, literature, film, advertising, and mass media. We will also consider how language does important social work in specific contexts, such as classrooms, courtrooms, medical settings, and political campaigns.",

When you hear the news or a teacher talking, do you feel directly addressed? Do you feel like you are a “they” in your classes and in popular discourse? We feel when we are being talked to, talked with, or talked about, and that makes a difference in how we relate to ourselves and each other. In this class, we talk together. We make language and we make space. This class is an experiment in empowerment that comes from using reading in linguistic anthropology to analyze linguistic oppression, appropriation, and exploitation.",

Where do archaeology and history contribute to the ossification and legitimation of culinary traditions and practices? There are many stakes tied to such questions—nutritional, religious, ethnic, institutional, governmental, and touristic, among others. In this course, we address relationships between food history and gastronomic heritage, drawing on examples from around the world and across media, including cookbooks, international policy reports, and video game representations. We examine culinary dimensions considered &quot;traditional&quot; by local communities and federal agencies, the archaeological and historical sources of such narratives (if they exist), and impacts of gastronomic heritage on modern practices, identities, and economies.",

While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world.

The archaeological starting-point is provided by the numerous scatters of surface remains that archaeological surveys across the Mediterranean have collected and that are usually interpreted as 'farmsteads' broadly datable to Classical Antiquity. We will look beyond these scatters to examine the social and economic significance of rural settlement through comparison with ethnographic and historical rural studies from across the Mediterranean and to explore household and community organisation and agrarian production in Classical Antiquity.

Using evidence from archaeology as well as texts in translation (letters, treaties, royal propaganda, chronicles), we will explore both what happened in the ancient Middle East and how modern scholars piece together histories of the forgotten past.

And yet, wild yeast grow everywhere in our everyday environments outside of the research lab; nature has provided rich genetic diversity among these yeast species that go unstudied in a research setting.

It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of &quot;geroscience&quot; – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800.",

This project aims to celebrate the poetry, music, and art produced within global systems of incarceration in the present and historically. Students will collectively and individually support the artists’ research in a variety of ways: for example, by conducting research at the Hay Library’s Voices of Mass Incarceration in the United States archive; co-producing interview questions for subjects; and considering the unique challenges of staging a site-specific installation. The class outcomes far outlive one semester, as Prisoner of Love will debut as a visual art exhibition and performance program at The Bell in spring 2026.",

We will read Virgil’s Aeneid and other major works of Latin literature in translation, consider some of the most canonical works of ancient art and architecture, and place both in the context of broader Roman culture and lived experience.

Far from simply assimilating Greek myths and changing the names of divinities and heroes, the Romans were highly creative in their adaptation of myths from various other cultures. They had a rich store of myths and legends of their own, including dual foundation stories for Rome itself (Aeneas and the Trojans; Romulus and Remus) as well as mytho-historic tales of exemplary heroes and heroines (e.g. Horatius and Lucretia) whose exploits provided models for future Roman generations. Even obviously flesh-and-blood persons (e.g. Regulus, Hannibal, Caesar, Cleopatra) take on mythical status. We'll focus on the ancient material - literature, art, architecture, religious rituals - with a look as well at the rich reception of Roman mythology in later literature and art. We'll consider also the way the Romans themselves understood – and manipulated – their myths.",

In one view, the hippocampus is essential for forming memories of the unique episodes in our lives. In another, the hippocampus is devoted to spatial navigation, encoding a spatial map of the world and our location in it. Reconciling these viewpoints has posed a significant scientific challenge. This seminar examines differing perspectives on how the hippocampus contributes to cognition and behavior, with the goal of integrating evidence from multiple subfields of psychology and neuroscience.",

The human mind strives to resolve the competing pressures of self-interest against the greater good. By drawing upon many disciplines including philosophy, social and affective neuroscience, abnormal psychology, law, and experimental economics, this course covers topics from 18th-century philosophy to modern-day neuroscience. We will examine 1) the philosophical and epistemological foundations of moral thought, 2) the influence of emotion and contextual framing on moral action, 3) the psychopathology of immoral choice, and 4) the underlying cognitive and neurobiological processes that guide moral decision-making. Registration for this course will be determined by the faculty on the first day of class. The final class list is determined by 1) some working knowledge in cognitive neuroscience (evidence by taking at least 1 prior class in the concentration), 2) who shows up to the first class, 3) the student's year (seniority is prioritized) and 4) when people emailed the faculty member to get on the class list.",

However, those under Iberian and British Rule—in Peru, Mexico and New England—found ways to resist and negotiate the terms of domination by adopting, and therefore adapting, European forms and norms. This class takes an interdisciplinary approach that combines historiography, literature, and art, to analyze the mechanisms of Indigenous resistance within the developing structures of colonialism: race, religion, geography, and gender. We will read a variety of texts that originate from Aztec, Inca, Algonquian, Spanish, Brazilian, and British contexts.

Through a sampling of poetry, narrative, and film, we will explore the uneven terrain of the Anthropocene, in which the feedback loops of race, class, gender, and other forms of social difference, along with geography itself, continue to separate humans, even as evidence mounts for the inseparability of humans from the rest of the planet, including its nonhuman inhabitants.

Listening or not listening also has to do with the exercise of power and this is the reason why we have a responsibility as listeners. In order to explore what could be described as the politics of listening, we will follow multiple paths that will lead us from the strategies of listening in concert venues to the medical practice of auscultation and the generalization of surveillance techniques. Our seminar will interweave readings in literature or theory (Kafka, Nietzsche, Calvino, Foucault, Chekhov, Freud, Deleuze. . .) and screenings of selected filmic scenes.",

It focuses on functional programming, which provides a new experience for students who have already done some programming and a solid foundation for students who have never programmed at all. Students learn to design solutions to computational problems, solutions that are compact, elegant, and efficient. Over the course of the semester, the computational problems addressed grow in complexity, from simple (e.g. long addition) to moderate (e.g. implementation of one programming language in another) to sophisticated (e.g. an implementation of an AI game player for two-person games of complete information). We study clear and precise formulation of computational problems, use of recursion, and rudimentary analysis of algorithms. The emphasis is on problem solving and insight and crafting beautiful things rather than on coding.",

Through the lens of computation, the focus is the design and analysis of systems utilized by self-interested agents. Students will investigate how the potential for strategic agent behavior can\/should influence system design, and the ramifications of conflicts of interest between system designers and participating agents. Emphasis on computational tractability is paramount, so that simple designs are often preferred to optimal. Students will learn to analyze competing designs using the tools of theoretical computer science, and empirical tools, such as empirical game-theoretic analysis. Application areas include computational advertising, wireless spectrum, and prediction markets.",

We will use Lean to verify properties of functional programs and theorems from pure mathematics. We will learn the theory of deductive reasoning and the logic that these tools are based on.

In practice, we often do not face worst-case scenarios, and the question arises of how we can tune our algorithms to work even better on the kinds of instances we are likely to see, while ideally keeping a rigorous formal framework of analysis. In this graduate seminar course, we will review several alternatives to worst-case analysis, developed largely in the theoretical computer science literature over the past 20 years, and their most notable algorithmic applications. Subjects include: parametrized analysis, instance optimality, semirandom models, smoothed analysis, comparative analysis, and",

Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history.

We will examine how the gender system was both shaped by other social and cultural phenomena and in turn impacted other aspects of culture and society. The course follows a roughly chronological trajectory: each section of the course will be devoted to a particular set of historical issues that was particularly salient in that period. We will examine how gender relations intersected with philosophical ideals, political agendas, religious values, and economic developments, and how individuals navigated the gender system to construct meaningful lives.",

Economists often need to test the validity of competing theories and to analyze government and business policies. Econometrics provide them with the necessary tools. The course starts with an exposition of descriptive statistics and essential probability concepts. Then, students will be introduced to statistical inference, estimation and hypothesis testing. The second half of the course will be devoted to regression analysis. Theory will always be illustrated with examples, and emphasis will be placed on the connection between the theory and actual data processing.

The analysis proposes a resolution for some of the most fundamental mysteries of the journey of humanity: What trapped humankind in poverty for most of human existence? What sparked the massive metamorphosis in living standards over the past two centuries? And what led to the emergence of immense inequality across nations?",

Particular attention focuses on reading engagement for adolescents, the availability of “own voices” texts, access to literacy and fluency through adolescent literature, and issues of censorship in American public school classrooms and libraries. Students in this course will develop an understanding of the place of adolescent literature in today’s curriculum debates as well as a background in choosing, reading, and analyzing the literature itself.

Students will learn how this ancient state constantly reinvented itself, through the rule of an elite class of priests, Kushite Pharaohs and Assyrian invaders, a Saite Renaissance and interactions with Greek colonists, Persian occupations and revolts, and the rise and fall of the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

Such flows have variable density over space and time. They can expand to take the shape of their volume or be compressed into an enclosing, confined space. These flows surround (air), inflate (air in lungs), compress (impact), hold\/push (drag\/thrust), and levitate (flight) us. We investigate flows to design and take advantage of their behavior for engineering solutions (e.g., extracting energy). You will learn to identify a fluid and develop the mathematical framework (differential equations) that describe compressible flow motion\/dynamics. We study fundamental thin airfoil, wing, and boundary layer theory. We will consider extracting energy from air flows using wind turbines. We conclude by surveying advanced topics involving supersonics, hypersonics, and space propulsion.",

Moving beyond highly controlled scenarios presents many challenges. Most importantly, mobile robots will interact in complex environments with other robots and people. How can we ensure robots safely do what we want them to do? What are the ethical ramifications of multirobot systems? In this course, we study the past, present, and future of coordinated mobile robotics, including a discussion of ethics.

So is what we’re reading when we read pre-1700 material even literature?

Culturally, 1984 brought us Ghostbusters and The Terminator; Louise Erdrich’s Love Medicine and Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being; Prince's Purple Rain; the creation of Tetris; and the rise of the infomercial. By focusing on a single year, we consider how culture and politics intertwine in an unfolding history, and how myths animate lived experience.

We will study Clifton’s engagement with the theological—especially of the Edenic—as a praxis for exploring trauma, language, time, and the beginning of the world. Most centrally, we will consider Clifton’s deployment of brevity, of vernacular or everyday language, as a philosophical and aesthetic enactment of ordinariness.",

In this seminar, we study fiction by South African writers who used the English language. The writers address moral and aesthetic questions occasioned by the challenge of trafficking in imaginative literature in a South Africa governed by repressive regimes of white supremacy. At the level of form, they do so in diverse ways. Issues that will engage us include debates around such literary-critical concepts as: protest, realism, modernism, and the “post-apartheid” in literature. Works by Brutus, Coetzee, Fugard, Gordimer, La Guma, Mda, Ndebele, Paton, Plaatje, and Wicomb. We will also discuss some poetry and the films Cry, the Beloved Country (1951; 1995), and Tsotsi (2005).",

Should we study a literary work as an entity unto itself, or does context play such a crucial role in the generation of meaning that we mustn’t ignore it? Or is it somehow necessary to treat a work of literature as both entirely independent and completely saturated with its cultural moment? We’ll explore these and many other problems inherent to the study of what is called literature. Authors may include Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and others.",

Does it, as one prominent theorist has proposed, denote “a new craving for reality in contemporary literature,” or is its significance on the contrary, in the words of another critic, that it “neatly and economically poses the question of the self as fiction”? This course will survey a range of “autofictional” practices in literature, art, and film, and consider several explanations for this wave of interest. Authors include Knausgaard, E. Hardwick, G. Murnane, Teju Cole, Sophie Calle, J. Panahi, Paul B. Preciado, A. Ernaux, F. Jameson, T. Moi, A. Kim.",

As this potentially interminable catalogue suggests, the late is not invariably attached to notions of mastery or wisdom, ripeness or completion, as the signifier of a desired end. In Late Style, Edward Said aligned lateness with &quot;intransigence and unresolved contradiction,&quot; indeed, with a kind of failure. This course examines the vicissitudes of the literary formalisms of the last century: have they reached a “late” moment, an intransigent but generative impasse?",

    "course_description": "Political ecology asks how power mediates human-environment relationships. How do we, as society, understand “the environment,” environmental problems, our role in them, and potential solutions? How have human-environment interactions reproduced inequity related to class, race, gender, and worldview; how does inequity, in turn, relate to environmental realities? Whose environmental “truth” counts, whose doesn’t, and why? Are better futures possible (and who defines “better futures”)? In this course, we will consider these questions and more. We will examine how knowledge production and socio-economic structures and processes relate to environmental change across economic, political, social, and ecological contexts. The first part of the course will introduce political ecology’s roots and major arguments. We will use this foundation to analyze real-world cases and consider the opportunities, or “openings,” for different environmental futures.",

In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of cartography and map design. Students will critique and create appealing maps throughout the semester. There isn’t a prerequisite for the course, however, an introductory level of GIS will be helpful to understand the terminology and the concepts. If you haven’t taken any GIS course before, some basics will be covered during the training assignments.

Using a variety of marine policy sectors (e.g., fisheries, energy, and biodiversity management), we will critically evaluate management tools (e.g., market mechanisms, regulations, area-based management, and community-based management).

What are the roles of science, knowledge, institutions, history, and context in how ocean governance plays out on the ground (or in the waves!)?",

This seminar will explore China’s environmental history from early times to the present by focusing on the words of people in China, which we will read in translation. China’s prosperity was historically based on millions of people producing food and other materials from the land, often replacing natural ecosystems with farms, tree plantations and other human ecosystems. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 this has been combined with intensive government development projects and highly polluting industrialization. We will read a wide variety of translated sources to understand this history, including landscape poetry, medical manuals, travel narratives, geographies, laws, Buddhist texts, recipe books, and even science fiction.",

In this course, we will consider how individuals’ understandings of climate change are deeply shaped by relations of power, from corporate strategies to delay meaningful action on climate change, to the norms and operations of media institutions, to dominant environmentalist discourses that fail to engage larger socioeconomic structures. While we will primarily discuss how public understanding has historically been constrained by the operation of power, we consider throughout possibilities for crafting climate narratives that resist these limitations to pursue transformative change. This course will focus primarily on climate politics in the United States, but we will also consider other national contexts and impacts on communities across the globe.",

Departing from the cultural expressions linked to US Latinx civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s, this class will dwell on diverse formal and thematic approaches and foci in contemporary US Latinx Art to reflect more broadly on the ideological impact of expressive culture.

    "course_description": "This undergraduate seminar explores U.S. urban and suburban histories during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, through the concerns of race and ethnicity. We seek to understand how dilemmas over and struggles for belonging and equality in the United States have played out in and over urban and suburban spaces. We will pay particular attention to the histories of segregation, housing discrimination, urban unrest, suburban integration, the rise of “ethnoburbs,” and gentrification. Readings represent foundational texts and new directions in scholarship and provide in-depth examinations of particular urban and suburban communities. Topics include the simultaneous erasure and appropriation of Indigenous peoples in the development of Pacific Northwest cities; the Asian American “model minority” and integration of all-white suburbs; minority grassroots activism and resistance against redevelopment; racism and neoliberal urban governance in the 21st century.

Using a comparative approach, we will examine how similar folkloric plots are treated across different contexts, but also how and why certain tales are privileged in each culture. Along with critical readings and films, we will study adaptations by d’Aulnoy, Perrault, Ben Jelloun, Mammeri, Senghor, Dadié, Diop, and Chamoiseau, among others. Taught in French.",

The need for such a perspective is represented by Frantz Fanon’s Pan-Africanism, which calls for the abolition of the Saharan frontier between &quot;North&quot; and &quot;Black&quot; Africa. Marginalized or simply unknown authors will be studied, including: Abdelkebir Khatibi, Paulin Hountondji, Fabien Eboussi Boulaga, Malek Bennabi, Youssef Seddik, Hichem Djaït, Mohammed Talbi, Lepold Sedar Senghor, among others.",

    "course_description": "Barthes and Derrida developed their reputations as thinkers along very different tracks: Barthes from a literary and rhetorical perspective, Derrida within the philosophical tradition. Both posed persistently and explicitly the question of literature. For Barthes, this involved putting literary texts to the test of new forms of analysis based on structuralist and semiological research, while arguing for a discipline that exposed “the place and energy of the [reading] subject.” Derrida often used literature to challenge traditional philosophy, and play a double-agent role within his sense of “writing,” while also analyzing its resources on their own terms, revealing criticism’s lack of both rigor and adventure, and relating literary questions to high stakes political and ethical questions. We will study a representative series of texts by Barthes and Derrida that continue to provide important models for a critical approach to literary writing.",

Since its most recent renaissance in the mid-2010s, the Sapphic has emerged as an elusive disruptor; an umbrella term that welcomes lesbians, wlw, nonbinary and trans femmes and mascs. This seminar explores how the Sapphic functions not just as an identity category but a methodology (a way of reading, writing, looking, listening) and an aesthetic in art, design, fashion, and food. What are the ways in which the Sapphic works with\/against lesbian and queer political identities? How does contemporary use of the Sapphic diverge from its past iterations in literature, literary criticism, and visual culture? How might we understand temporality in Sapphic expression (slow-burn, yearning)? Competency in Sapphic arts requires participation in seminar discussions, completion of 3 short essays, and a final essay\/creative project.",

This course considers epistemology from the perspective of what we don’t know, what we refuse to know, and what we can’t know. Drawing from philosophical, decolonial, theological, psychoanalytic, sociological, feminist, queer, and trans discourses, this interdisciplinary course explores such concepts as Glissant’s “right to opacity,” Sedgwick’s ignorances and nonce taxonomies, and Žižek's theory of ideology as fetishistic disavowal. Texts will include Beauchamp’s Going Stealth, Derrida’s “How to Avoid Speaking: Denials,” Freud’s “Fetishism,” Glazer’s Zone of Interest, C.

We will start with the premise that studies in gender and sexuality are tied together by questioning foundational assumptions within a given field of knowledge and taking account of our own subject positions vis-à-vis our objects of study. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and\/or queer focus, we will investigate how gender and sexuality are constructed in various contexts, what kind of work they do, and how standards of evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines. Particular attention will be given to the role of critique, affect, and materialisms, including the materiality of language, in gender and sexuality studies.",

In 1775, after its discontinuation, Claudius started collecting his own contributions to the newspaper and to publish them under the title Sämtliche Werke des Wandsbecker Boten. Similarly, yet differently, another project––a calendar addressed to the peasant population of Baden––materialized 40 years later: Der Rheinländische Hausfreund, written by Johann Peter Hebel, who edited the calendar between 1808 and 1815. Due to its huge success, the best stories from the first four issues were published as a book in 1811: Schatzkästlein des rheinischen Hausfreunds. This extraction of their contributions for both newspaper and calendar underlines the subversive character of Claudius’ and Hebel’s projects. Both their writings went beyond the day: into a sphere where chronological and calendaric time implode.––Taught in German.",

Almost 50 years later, Jacob Grimm delivers a lecture under a similar yet slightly––and decisively––different title: Das Wort des Besitzes, dealing not only with the history and semantics of the word Besitz but with the word itself. His lecture transforms a juridical question into a linguistic one: how is it possible (and is it possible at all) to possess a word? In other words: to turn a language into one’s own in order to possess it? The seminar will discuss aspects of this question in philosophical, linguistic, and literary texts by (among others) Kant, Babeuf, Proudhon, Hölderlin, Marx, Droste-Hülshoff, and Franz Kafka.––Taught in German.",

In German-language literature, political models of society, psychological theories on the dynamics of thinking and feeling, and critical discussions of history are often negotiated on the basis of an outline of what childhood is. This is because studying how humans develop promises to provide insight into what it means to be human and permits one to construct images of how humans should live. This line of thought breaks from a centuries-old convention of equating children with animals due to their lack of articulate speech and regretting this phase. In this course, we will read key texts of German-language literature from the Enlightenment to the present day that expound childhood as a special, formative epoch of individual life that, at the same time, grants insight into social dynamics.",

On the other hand, there is also the obverse, where the optical stands for superficiality, mere appearance, and even deception and confusion. In other words, when we take a closer look at ‘seeing,’ things appear more complicated than they did at first glance. Texts and movies by Plato, Sophocles, Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, E.T.A.

Our seminar will examine the “darkness of the lived moment,” as Ernst Bloch, the great political philosopher of hope, named it. What appears in the immediacy of our experience, is actually far removed from our understanding, but it does open onto an unforeclosed futurity. We will contemplate this darkness of the lived moment in a constellation of works drawn from literature and the arts; and in relation to theoretical texts by such thinkers as Bloch, Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, and Blanchot.",

To engage with this tension, we will read theoretical texts that continue to inform current memory debates (Arendt, Mitscherlich), recent social sciences approaches to transgenerational transmissions of psycho-social sequelae of perpetration and complicity (Welzer &amp; al., Mihai, Gobodo-Madikizela), and literary texts that have brought transgenerational transmissions into the focus of public attention (Bernhard, Sebald), in order then to focus on contemporary German-language texts that negotiate the difficulties of commemorating totalitarianisms.",

Among the questions to be asked: What is first philosophy and how does Lambda—finally developing Aristotle's theology—fit into that larger project? How does God govern the cosmos as an object of love? How should we understand the claims that God thinks himself and that “thinking is thinking of thinking”?",

Uninterrupted contact produced richly complex patterns of cultural exchange whose legacy is variously embraced and debated today. This first-year seminar will examine relationships between Muslims, Jews, and Christians from the perspectives of literature, music, art, architecture, archaeology, and history. While largely focusing on the centuries of co-existence, we will also consider the expulsions and forced conversions of Jews and Muslims that took place after 1492, as well as the resurgence of these communities in contemporary Spain. Throughout, students will acquire theoretical bases for understanding current interreligious conflict and for envisioning its repair. Instruction in Spanish.",

Starting with Latin American historians who have written on who is and who gets to be human in the region, we will explore various aspects of the Latin American human and posthuman condition through analyzing non-textual media, literature, cultural essays, and the historical framework that produced them.

Assuming no prior knowledge of a region that persistently captures headlines, this course provides a robust introduction to modern Middle East history, with two parts: (1) a brief history of the early-modern Ottoman Empire, from the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 to imperial collapse in WWI; and (2) the dramatic remaking of Southern Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and North Africa into a new “Mideast\/MENA” region from Ottoman partition to present times. Throughout, we explore the pivotal role of this region—and narratives about its past—from a variety of “3D” perspectives: water, soil, fossil fuels; governance and trade; religion\/spirituality, law, and family life; art, literature, music, and sports; and nationalism, militarism, humanitarianism, and environmentalism.",

Political philosophy is the focus, but we also examine the institutions that were developed to translate ideals into action and to the tensions that arose as a consequence of efforts to reconcile different political philosophies in practice during the imperial period. The last section of the course is devoted to the radical changes in thinking and government institutions that take place over the course of the late nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries.",

Psychoanalytic knowledge added the inner, mental (psychic) lives of people and cultures. Psychoanalysis redefined the humanities, the social sciences, and their relationships, paving the way as well for new approaches such as gender and sexuality studies. We will focus on the role of psychoanalysis as a political science, attuned to the modes of mass and media politics of the 20th and 21st centuries.",

Throughout the course we will be thinking about gender relations as relationships of power: about how power was gendered in political, economic, social, and cultural institutions and spheres; and about how the intersection of gender with class, religious belief, and medicine shaped power relationships. We will also be particularly attentive to women’s participation in these power relationships—that is, the ways in which they could (and did) reinforce, manipulate, exploit, subvert, or resist them.",

We will examine the religious, political, racial, and economic bases for these slave systems, and compare the experiences of individual slaves and slave societies. Topics discussed include gender and sexuality (e.g. the institution of the Harem and the eunuchs who ran it), the connection between piracy and slavery, and the roles of slavery in shaping the Western world.

During Joseph Stalin’s reign the people of the Soviet Union experienced events of astonishing scale and revolutionary change. Rapid industrialization, massive collectivization, famine, purges, state terror, devastating world war, and foreign occupation brought unprecedented suffering and premature death to tens of millions of Soviet citizens. Given the size of the topic and the limited hours in a semester, this course focuses on Stalin’s rise to power and his reign in the 1930s. Rather than surveying the views of a wide range of scholars, we will delve into two very long works of recent scholarship in depth. This is a reading intensive course.",

In engaging with such primary sources, we will consider how rival visions of imperialism shaped ideological traditions as diverse as liberalism, fascism, conservatism, and communism.",

Despite our growing awareness of the legacies and current realities of oppression, the deeper history of the mobilization of resistance to pervasive oppression in the past has become obscured by the passage of time, and misunderstood through selective citation and decontextualization. By carefully analyzing and contextualizing the writings by earlier generations we can thus better understand our own time, how we got to where we are, and how we can steer our future to safer and more just shores. Some great minds in the past have thought about the questions that concern us today. This course introduces students to these voices in the belief that they can serve as a guide to grasp the complexities of our own time.",

Students will analyze the built environment and character of the site to create contextual building designs that strengthen a neighborhood. The final presentation will require a complete set of drawings, renderings, a shared urban context model, and a large-scale model of the proposed building design. A jury of invited architects and professors will conduct a discussion of each project in an exhibition-like setting at the List Art Center. This course can be repeated once for credit.",

But holy powers could also be malevolent, so ancient art served to protect, warn, or ward off evil spirits.

This will lead us to interrogate what remains of the possibility of a shared breathing in the era of climate change, gas warfare, and privat(izat)ion of air: Peter Sloterdijk’s notion of “atmoterrorism” or Elias Canetti’s idea of a “breath economy” will be brought into conversation with M. nourbeSe Philip’s writing of the “ga(s)p” or Clarice Lispector’s Breath of Life; Edgar Poe’s apneic imagination in “Loss of Breath” will resonate against the racial politics of spirometry. Finally, our readings will raise the question of breath and freedom: is respiration a mere reflex mechanism or can it be turned into an affirmative action?",

Indeed, face, understood as singularity, is for Emmanuel Levinas what grounds the ethical relation to the other. But faces, as deepfakes have shown, are also utterly replicable: they can be grafted, mimicked, appropriated, forged. Our collaborative humanities seminar will delve into the representations of faces (portraits, self-portraits, selfies, close-ups), the classification of faces (Johann Kaspar Lavater’s physiognomy, the iconography of hysteria, Cesare Lombroso’s Criminal Man), the staging of faces (pornography), the racial politics of faces (Blackface, facial recognition, Frantz Fanon’s notion of mask), and the philosophy of “faceity” (Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben).",

Historically, one reason Americans have been thought to tolerate inequality is that we tend to believe that our society is a mobile one, where people can easily move from one social class to another. But in recent years, inequality and stagnant social mobility have been associated with increasing social and political distrust and unrest. In this junior seminar, we will examine the economic and political, and ideological factors that have contributed to this historical moment, learn about how Americans experience living in an unequal society, and consider the future of equality and social mobility in the United States. How should our society be shaped, and what are our obligations as members of that society?",

It focuses on the concept of smart production as an outgrowth of flexible production, which is changing relationships between the human body and machine, collective and individual data extraction, and their social adaptations. Through an analysis of these transformations, the class will examine how our ideas of scale, especially the concept of “local”, and the meaning of value are being reimagined, and what effect this has on interactions between state, society and market.",

In what ways are governing practices under the Chinese socialist system similar to, or different from, those under liberal democracies? In this seminar course, students will explore these questions through scholarly discussions on governance in the realms of bureaucracy, economic market, technology and media, population, public health, and family.

Some observers argue that only market competition can enable the blossoming of human ingenuity, while others argue that state planning is essential for controlling the dangers inherent in new technologies. Rather than extol or deny the benefits that can come from technology, this course examines how governments in different historical circumstances have attempted to shape and regulate three of the most challenging risks facing advanced societies.",

This course will take a pragmatic approach to understanding how the legal, ethical, and technical principles of humanitarian assistance get translated into actual impact on the ground during large-scale emergencies worldwide. In particular, we will explore the justifications and limitations for humanitarian response as a tool for addressing modern challenges ranging from climate change to civil conflict, alongside new efforts to improve both the effectiveness of humanitarian response and its accountability to affected populations. This course will cover a diverse range of topics including the history, structure, and financing of humanitarian response; the public health evidence base for common human security interventions; and the intersections between human rights and humanitarianism.",

What caused the Cold War? Did nuclear weapons change the way that states negotiated with one another? How much did individuals make a difference during interstate crises? Why did states sometimes fail to reach peaceful settlements with one another? What were the experiences of states other than the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War? How have social and economic institutions changed international politics in the twenty-first century?",

We will then look at various approaches to the text, from (post)structuralist, psychoanalytic and theological interpretations, to then connect the novel to contemporary issues related to ecocriticism, animal studies, posthumanism, and the digital revolution. After reading the novel, the focus will shift to scrutinizing various modern and contemporary retellings, aiming to unravel the relevance of the “Pinocchio myth” today. This prompts an inquiry into the persisting presence of Pinocchio in Western culture and invites contemplation on the reasons behind its continual resurgence. Taught in English.",

Starting from the partisan Resistance against the Nazi-Fascist regime (1943-45), we will touch upon several historical uprisings: civil rights movements, feminist movements, the so-called Years of Lead, anti-mafia activism, anti-globalization movements, antiracist activism. From literature to film\/tv series, from photography to visual art to poetry, artists have politically engaged, challenged and modified the idea of resistance embedded within the identity of contemporary Italians. We look at artistic expressions of resistance performed against different forms of power (nationalism, the colonial state, the patriarchal family, the Mafia, the Church, police violence). We interrogate how the idea of resistance comes to structure Italian culture today and how it reverberates in mainstream narratives of what it means to be Italian.",

The study of gender has profoundly shaped the practice of history in the last half century, and the course outlines its impact and its transformations. The course places in conversation diverse but overlapping historical developments: the impact of the study of gender on history; influences from beyond history that have shared or shaped historians’ approach to gender and sexuality; the particular inflections of the study of gender in the case of Italy (1400-1800); the impact of the turn to the study of sexuality and queer studies. The course explores and critiques the limits of our gender constructs (theoretical, methodological, and modern) for explaining the culture of people in the premodern world and beyond the western hemisphere, fields of scholarship where the universality of contemporary notions of gender have been challenged.

In this course, we will not seek to answer the question of the “Parting of the Ways” as much as we will critique it. Our aim is to reframe this crucial question by reflecting on the categories of religion, conversion, origins, narrative, and history, among others. We will read through a wide variety of ancient literature (including canonical and non-canonical Christian texts, rabbinic literature, Jewish poetry) and broach modern forms of “Jewish Christianity.”",

The path that an artist takes to develop a work is one that is non-linear, messy, and full of wonderful byways.

We’ll dispel this darkness by reading works by a range of novelists. How do these authors strike a balance between complex thought and elegant\/unusual structure? And how can we, as writers, maintain narrative coherence over the course of hundreds of pages?",

    "course_description": "This course offers an introduction to Iranian cinema, moving chronologically from 1960 to 2024. While offering a historical account of Iranian cinema, this course addresses questions related to aesthetics, genre, style, and criticism, as well as sociopolitical and cultural categories such as gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, body, marriage and family, religion, national identity, language, power, politics and war. Rather than focusing exclusively on arthouse cinema, this course will draw attention to the heterogeneous body of Iranian cinema, including popular genres, exilic and diasporic films, as well as experimental, documentary films and visual anthropology. Examining Iranian cinema’s cross-cultural references, its relation to cinemas of the region and to transnational and global aesthetics, this course critically examines the category of national cinema. No prior knowledge of Iranian cinema or Persian\/Farsi required (films will be screened with English subtitles).",

To answer this question, this course attends to the particulars of the computer as a mathematical proposition, to its claim to legitimacy as a logic of superior military and political organization, and to its elaboration as something of a natural philosophy in scientific practice. In doing so, we will formulate a conceptual basis to critically assess the glittery promises of current discourse invoking Artificial Intelligence (A.I), which sees near-total automation as inevitable and the threat of sentient Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I) as nigh. We will establish a critique of the computer as a structure (as a philosophical arrangement with a specific and persistent imagination) to think critically about popular ideologies associated with A.I., often put forward by those with capital stake in its commercial success.",

Through close readings, guest speakers, site visits and sustained cultural analysis, we acquire a critical understanding of the potentialities of queer &quot;after hours&quot; in the making of subcultural identity and emerging aesthetic practices.

Inquiries into form highlight defamiliarization and (a)historicism; plasticity and formlessness; aesthetics and heteroglossia; dissensus and engagement. Articulating questions of form with questions reading refocuses our attention on the work of form: form as process, as productive, as reformation. Our course will approach the issues of subjectivity and theoretical objects, ideology and pleasure, new formalisms and the politics of the aesthetic in theoretical work from the twentieth and twentieth century across the disciplines.

Topics will include musical improvisation and competition, in forums ranging from rap battles to air guitar; the role of sound in professional sports marketing and in-game experience design; the songs that enliven children’s games and the soundtracks of video games; forms such as capoeira, which involve playful interaction in several different domains; and many more.",

The range of answers gave birth to a musical style that looked backwards into the Baroque for textural density and flow, abandoning the articulated symmetry of the classical phrase, while pushing the harmonic language, musical drama, and effect into new horizons. All the while, the search for alternative structures and points of musical departure, resulted in a new sort of interaction between music and other art forms. Schumann’s E.T.A Hoffman’s inspired character pieces, Berlioz’s program music, the proliferation of the Lied, Liszt’s Dante Sonata and Petrarca sonnets are telling examples of this search for a new musical style and context.",

A major component will be examining repertoire of the past sixty years, seeing how new techniques, aesthetics, and technologies (new instruments, computer-assisted orchestration, acoustics) have influenced how composers approach writing for the orchestra. We will explore pathbreaking works that involve spatialization, alternative tunings, and improvisation. Orchestras are natural vehicles for new ways of thinking about sound and the concert experience, but in dealing with economic realities and a commitment to canonical practice, they are also the most resistant to change. What are the limitations and expectations of music created for these institutions? How is cultural prestige at play, and what roles do artistic administrators, composers-in-residence, publishers, and critics play in programming? And how might new initiatives for young composers and underrepresented voices change relationships to audiences?",

What aspects of your language (reading, writing, listening, speaking, cultural context) will you focus on, and why? What resources will be most helpful and what challenges of learning your language exist? How will they benefit your academic study and professional trajectory? The scholarly context of this course emerges from a need to address the legacies of destruction to Indigenous peoples. Given the history of cultural and linguistic genocide, Native voices and ways of knowing will be centered, using community resources, oral histories, and Native scholars as a support network for study, guided by principles such as relationships to heritage languages, Indigenous epistemologies, land relations, music, and gender.",

We will start with Confucius, Mencius, and Zhuangzi in the Warring States, to Laozi in the Western Zhou Dynasty, and end with Wang Yang Ming in the Ming Dynasty. Crucially, the course involves an experimental element: students will be asked to not only think about sagehood, but also experiment with living like a sage. We will thus be experimenting with several meditation methods, reflection methods, and discussion methods. This course will also involve a field trip to an art museum.",

Yet many wish we did not. Historically, the greatest opposition has come from those who have described themselves as socialists. While socialism underwent a loss of popularity in the latter part of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st due to the failures of self-described socialist regimes, it appears to be regaining popularity, at least among younger generations. But which is in fact better: capitalism or socialism? The question can still provoke heated debate. In this course, we will explore the ethical arguments for and against these economic systems, as well as ethical questions that each system raises.

Epicurus recommends that we “[g]et used to believing that death is nothing to us” (Letter to Menoeceus, trans. Inwood and Gerson). Epictetus tells us: “Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well” (Handbook 8, trans. White). Lucretius describes at length the “ills” that are “experienced in love that is steadfast and supremely successful”—and adds that “when love is frustrated and unrequited, the miseries you can spot with your eyes shut are countless” (On the Nature of Things 4, trans. Ferguson Smith). What are we to make of all this advice? And what’s behind it?",

We examine classic theories of well-being: hedonistic, desire, and eudaimonistic theories, as well as new theoretical options (internalist and constitutivist theories). Then we consider different varieties of prudential goods, including happiness, meaningfulness, achievement. Finally, we look at questions of the proper scope of prudential value, in particular whether it is best understood as a property of a whole life.",

The Philebus is an ethical dialogue, which also explores method, metaphysics, cosmology, and epistemology, with fascinating treatments of sound and color. We aim to discuss the dialogue in detail and to consider relevant passages in other dialogues, such as perception and judgment in the Theaetetus, falsehood in the Sophist, two arts of measurement in the Statesman, the Good in the Republic, and perception and perceptible qualities in the Timaeus. Our questions include: what method is advocated in the Philebus and how does it relate to similar methods in the Phaedrus, Sophist, and Statesman? Plato’s Socrates plays with the notions of limit, unlimited, mixture, and cause. How do those notions contribute to his investigation of pleasure, knowledge, and the good life?",

This seminar is organized around the work of Chisholm, but it is not just about him. Chisholm had distinctive positions on most of the major topics in epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind, positions that were subsequently built upon or challenged by others. Tracing his views and the responses to them can thus serve as something of a history of metaphysics and epistemology over a 50-year period, leading up to contemporary debates and providing background for them. My plan is to pair the reading by Chisholm each week with one or more readings by other philosophers who subsequently expounded his work, built on it, criticized it, or set forth competing positions.",

Is there something special about humans acting as opposed to, say, cats who do things? What does it mean to act rationally and respond to reasons? Do we really decide which desire to act on, or does the strongest one always win? What happens in cases of drug addiction and other mental disorders? Can you intend to do something you don't know you'll do? Where does moral responsibility come in? How can you deceive yourself?",

Can the country itself be guilty of a wrong, or is that just loose talk meant to summarize the wrongdoing of a bunch of individual Americans? More generally, it is common to think of some groups of people, as distinct from the individuals themselves, as believing, wanting, intending, or deciding certain things, and the group itself as being permitted, forbidden from doing certain things, or responsible or to blame for some of the its actions. A related idea is so-called structural injustice (e.g., structural racism or sexism) in which a society is wrongful in its structures and institutions in some way irrespective any wrongful individual members. In this seminar we will study the difficult philosophical problems each of these ideas raises.",

Subsequently, we will transition to the post-communist era, focusing on contemporary efforts to revisit Poland’s past through haunting explorations of Polish-Jewish relationships, attentiveness towards minority groups, and the darkly comedic depictions of “the provincial” in films by Paweł Pawlikowski, Małgorzata Szumowska, and Wojtek Smarzowski, among others.",

In this course you'll explore the politics of money, investigating topics such as financial crises, the role of the central banks in managing money, and the rise of cryptocurrency. You'll also learn how to write about money and politics for different audiences, everyone from scholars and policymakers to everyday people who lack basic financial expertise. If you—like many people---find money fascinating, this course is for you. This course is for first- and second-year students and assumes no background in political science.

Throughout the semester, we will see that there is significant variation within Africa in the strength of states, levels of economic growth, and respect for democratic institutions; we will aim to explain these variations. We will primarily study events in particular African countries, but will also examine broad patterns across countries and use social science concepts and methods to try to explain them. In our exploration, we will mostly build on the work of political scientists but also draw heavily on work by journalists, psychologists, economists, and historians.",

Organized crime groups have significant influence in communities both historically and today, so we study why they exist and how they organize. Finally, we look at how political institutions affect crime and the operation of the criminal legal system, including persistent problems of racial disparities at all points in the system.",

For example, while governments are often cajoled and enjoined to produce economic growth, especially during recessions, do something about economic inequality and social mobility, and improve the life chances of millions through purposive action, actually delivering these things is incredibly hard. These areas constitute ‘“hard problems” for two main reasons. Economically, we don’t really have much of a clue about how to do many of these things. Politically, there are powerful interests that like these areas of policy just as they are, and they work to keep them “hard problems.”",

We will examine historical and demographic trends, including immigration patterns and Latine social\/labor movements, to see whether historical trends explain present behavior. We will also discuss topics related to Latine public opinion, voting patterns, and political representation.

The course provides opportunities to critique and construct theories and empirical analyses of public bureaucracies. It also provides opportunities for students to prepare for the comprehensive exams and to develop research agendas.

This sub-field has roots in International Political Economy, Fiscal and Economic Sociology, and Economics. It has as its main foci the politics of economic growth, distribution and (in)equality. The growth program emerged from work on comparative capitalisms in the 1970s and 1980s, coalescing in the highly influential Varieties of Capitalism literature in the 2000s, and latterly in the Growth Models research program. The distributional strand of work focused on the interaction of producer groups and sought to tie political and economic outcomes to the relative strength of such groups. The (in)equality side of the subfield emerged out of studies of welfare states and engagement with the social metrics of comparative economic performance. This course surveys this broad terrain.",

You will identify those actors, the combination of authorities, powers, interests, and constraints each one possesses. This framework for viewing stakeholders will enable you to strategize about how to engage different actors when and where they intervene in the policy process. As a policymaker, analyst, or advocate, you will have to contend with stakeholders that possess formal authorities to shape the policy process. These stakeholders will determine whether the problems that concern you reach the agenda; whether your preferred solution is adopted; how that policy solution is implemented; whether it diffuses from one political venue to another; and whether the policy endures, or reshapes politics, succumbs to termination or reform. We will catalog those authorities and powers and observe how they apply in real policy situations.",

Creating impact requires a thorough understanding of the problem at hand. A common mistake policy-makers, politicians, executives, or social business founders make is to address the problem they want to tackle as if it were “technical” i.e. only requiring expertise and appropriate tools. However, wicked problems have “adaptive” aspects: their root causes and their impact have to do with people’s beliefs, values, habits, or behaviors.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deeply polarized views among Americans about the role of government in public health and has laid bare vast structural health inequities. This course will explore the Constitutional foundations of public health law; how public health powers are distributed across different levels and branches of government; legal and policy strategies for addressing infectious and chronic diseases and injuries; and the role of laws and policies in structuring—and remedying—health inequities.",

The goal of this seminar is to introduce the basic principles of public health nutrition with a focus on the United States. Students will gain an understanding of the science behind government-issued dietary recommendations and learn about methods of dietary assessment, determinants of food intake and nutritional status, and individual-level and environmental-level interventions to improve diet. The course will emphasize the ways in which environmental factors and public policy can influence the nutritional status of diverse population groups. Through discussions and debates, students will explore and critically discuss current public health nutrition controversies, such as taxation of less healthful foods, nutrition restrictions on food stamp purchases, federal agricultural policy, and school food policy among other contested topics.",

Our goal is to develop a deeper understanding of the methods by reading the original papers and placing them in the context of what was occurring in the field at the time. Although our focus is on the development of methods in the field of epidemiology, what constitutes an “epidemiologic method” has become less clear as the lines dividing fields have blurred. Thus, several of the papers we will review come from the fields of computer science, econometrics, and biostatistics, among others.",

This course posits that public health experts rarely understand the full nature of previous crises, and argues that a better understanding of historical events will improve our response to future crises. Through thoughtful reflection and interactive discussion, we will explore the oft-repeated themes that continue to challenge public health and humanitarian response to this day, and examine the progress we’ve made as a field. Most importantly, we will question why lessons identified so often fail to become lessons learned.",

And while this approach has enabled scholars to neatly prescribe what counts as religious, it’s also caused them to ignore the ways people’s daily faith practices make a mess of this work. Drawing on sub-fields in religious studies, anthropology, and sociology, this course explores how formal ideas of religion expand when confronted with the normality of everyday life. From cooking and talking to prayer and devotion, the “religious” and “non-religious” things people do tell us a lot about how religion animates and is animated by lived experience, and how porous the boundary is between the “sacred” and “profane”.",

This course investigates the central role that religion and spirituality have played in the long, tangled history of psychedelics, from colonial eradication of psychedelics as indigenous sacraments, to psychedelic modes of expanding consciousness in 1960s counterculture; from the moral panic around these substances as a tool of mind control, to their present scientific investigation as a panacea for mental health, addiction, and self-realization. Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.",

The course discusses these theories in the context of Soviet and European modernist art and aesthetics of the 1920 and 30s. In English.",

Many scientific workers–including translators, activists, archivists, technicians, curators, and ethics review boards–are absent in publications and omitted from stories of discovery. Professional scientists are often celebrated, yet they are expected to uphold principles of ‘objective’ self-denial. This course will explore these silences and omissions to reveal how invisibilities have shaped twentieth and twenty-first century science. The course modules invites comparisons across geographic, temporal, and disciplinary boundaries. The modules also facilitate different forms of self-reflexive practice, and will open the possibilities of research avenues for students; how we should approach research and narrative method; and how contemporary interest in invisible labor relates to established discursive traditions in the historiography of science and STS.",

Feminist science studies provide a guide to the arts of noticing and staying with the troubles of our time but also for imagining otherwise. In this course we gather hope from ecofeminism in order to move towards a justice-oriented future. We do this by delving into the literature on ecofeminism alongside ecological speculative fiction. Recognizing that solutions to environmental problems require a feminist attunement, we can start to understand the implications that our ethical commitments have to the future of life on the planet.",

Why is there such a large gap between the &quot;modern&quot; ideal of formal equality and the reality of factual inequality? Why do differences of class, race and gender persist? What is power and who has it? These questions have motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the arguments continue to be informed by the foundational classical theorists: Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and W.E.B Du Bois. Looking at the transformations around them – the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the spread of colonialism, the decline of religion, struggles for emancipation and much more – they developed arguments that allow us to better understand ourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic and social transformations around us. We explore the defining contributions of these theorists and link them to current debates and theories on systemic racism, gender\/sex struggles, global inequalities, social movements and democracy.",

It examines how individual attitudes, actions, and interactions make a difference for organizational processes and outcomes. This focus is contrasted with more macro-level approaches, which take the organization (instead of the individual) as the primary unit of analysis. For example, studies of organizations from an economic perspective are typically concerned with the performance of the organization relative to its competitors. Studies of organizations from a macro-sociological focus are typically concerned with an organization's routines and structures, contextualized by the broader environment. SOC 1311 takes a more micro and meso perspective that asks questions such as, &quot;why do individuals in organization behave the way they do, how does this affect the organizations of which they are a part and how, in turn, are individuals affected by their organizations?&quot;",

Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.",
