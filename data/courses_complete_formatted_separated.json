political, and intellectual practices and experiences of people of African descent throughout the African diaspora. Beginning with a critical overview of the history, theoretical orientations, and multiple methodological strategies of the discipline, the course is divided into three thematic units that examine intellectuals, politics, and movements; identity construction and formation; and literary, cultural, and aesthetic theories and practices in the African diaspora.","1":"This course will focus on the life and legacy of Mary McLeod Bethune through an examination of her activism in the areas of education, politics, women's rights issues, civil rights issues, and world affairs. Throughout the course of her 79 years, she rose from humble beginnings in South Carolina, the daughter of formerly enslaved parents, to work with presidents and world leaders. She was born during the period of Reconstruction, and passed away the same year as the ruling of Brown vs. Board of Education was made, which will allow for a study of her participation in laying the foundation for the Modern Civil Rights Movement. Students will also gain experiential learning by visiting historic sites which preserve the legacy of Bethune, including the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House-National Historic Site and the Carter G. Woodson Home-National Historic Site.","2":"Twentieth Century Africa delves into the complex and problematic narratives surrounding Sub-Saharan Africa, examining how the continent has been historically misrepresented, misunderstood, and &quot;mistaken&quot; in various contexts. We critically analyze the notion of &quot;Mistaking Africa&quot; focusing on deconstructing stereotypes, challenging misconceptions, and promoting a more nuanced understanding of Sub-Saharan Africa's diverse cultures, histories, and contemporary realities. Students will read literature, analyze popular culture, and examine primary sources to study European imperialism and racism; colonial systems of forced labor and wage labor; African resistance and collaboration; the Christianizing and westernizing effects of colonial education; the transformation of gender, class, and ethnic identities, and African nations’ struggle for political autonomy.","3":"The decade from the mid-Sixties until the mid-Seventies witnessed the rise of Black Radicalism as a global phenomenon. The emergence of Black Power in the US, Brazil and the Caribbean, the consolidation of liberation struggles in Portuguese Africa and the rise of a Black Consciousness trend in Apartheid South Africa all represent key moments. What led young activists to embrace “Black Power?” What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa? What events in the Caribbean gave ascendancy to radical tendencies? And what forces contributed to the decline of these movements? This course seeks to answer these questions.","4":"This lecture\/seminar course delves into Brazil's Black legacy through contemporary creative productions. We will focus on how the dimensions of race, class, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality are portrayed in Brazilian literature and cultural expression forms. Through the lens of Brazilian Black feminism, we will examine how race relations have influenced Brazil's national identity. The curriculum integrates theoretical and critical readings from Black Brazilian female intellectuals, intersecting with various mediums such as fiction, graphic novels, films, music, and visual arts. These mediums serve as powerful tools to confront Brazil's history of slavery, challenge the notion of racial democracy, and foster positive transformations in Afro-Brazilian representation.","5":"What can home mean? What does it look like to leave, to search for, and to return, home? What kind of thinking is prompted by the experience of homecoming? What other topics come to mind when we think about home? In this undergraduate seminar, we will address the foregoing questions by studying poems, essays, memoirs, films, travelogues, short stories, and novels by Black thinkers from across the globe.","6":"In this undergraduate course, we will focus on the Harlem Renaissance, also known as the New Negro Movement, the important African American artistic and socio-cultural moment that dates roughly from 1919-1934. Organized as an interdisciplinary course, we will examine the historical context of the period; the literature including novels by Jean Toomer and Nella Larsen; the art including the painting of Aaron Douglas, the sculpture of Richmond Barthé, and the photography of James Van Der Zee; and classic female blues with a focus on the music and lyrics of Gertrude “Ma” Rainey and Bessie Smith. We will also read a range of writers from the period including Marita O. Bonner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Alain Locke, Elise Johnson McDougald, and George S. Schuyler.","7":"In the last decade, we have witnessed the acceleration of technological experimentation and production. As such, this class explores the role that Black speculation plays in helping us envision and create technocultures beyond empire. Together, we will explore imperialism and colonialism as they manifest in our digital age, paying particular attention to how digital technologies like predictive algorithms, machine learning, surveillance, and data extraction extend and innovate on these systems of power. After initial grounding in the study of technology, speculative art and literature, and speculative design, we will pivot to “labs” where you will be able to read and analyze Black speculative works, develop a Black speculative method based on these works, and apply that method to your design of a technological tool that addresses a social problem.","8":"This class examines Black women visual artists of the African Diaspora who are based in the United States and are part of the global contemporary art scene. We will study how race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity have forged and continued to shape Black female identity and creative production. The course is organized around three themes: (re)presenting the Black female body; globalization and migration; and performing\/visualizing self and community.","9":"This junior seminar course is designed to support students’ growth as academic writers and will prepare them to better complete their culminating senior thesis projects. While specifically geared towards Africana Studies concentrators, the class is open to any undergraduate student who has successfully completed AFRI 0090 : An Introduction to Africana Studies and at least four semesters of coursework overall towards the Bachelor’s degree. Course materials will delve deeply into the history, spaces, peoples and cultures of the African Diaspora, exploring a selection of critical writings, performance pieces, fiction and non-fiction works by leading scholars and artists.","10":"This course will explore the issues of Africana Studies as a discipline by engaging in a series of critical readings of the central texts, which laid the protocols of the discipline. The course will also raise issues of knowledge production and methodologies. This course is a senior capstone seminar. Open to all senior Africana Studies concentrators; others by instructor permission only. Enrollment limited to 25.","11":"From 18th Century slave revolts to the iconic Haitian Revolution, the Grenadian Revolution of 1979 and the 2019 popular uprisings in the Sudan, revolts and revolutions have undoubtedly occupied a hallowed place in the political imaginaries of the Black World. Reading narratives from a select group of instances, we will explore, against the broader theoretical work on global revolutions, the more specific meaning of revolution in Africana history and literature. The overriding question is, in the face of disappointing outcomes, tragedy and collapse, can the history of Black revolt and revolution still provide a framework for thinking about radical change in the 21st Century, or should we move beyond it?","12":"“caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare” (Audre Lorde) This course focuses on Black feminist thought through the lens of care as both theory and lived experience from the late twentieth century to the present. Care in the context of the course is a radical epistemology and praxis that might be defined as, in the words of Aisha K. Finch “to be about the business of living with people, sharing in and amplifying their life force, recognizing their value and worth.” Through the critical examination of a number of texts, the course will examine the multifaceted concept and practice of care in Black people’s lives as a contest against state power and a means of survival and joy.","13":"For graduate students who have met the tuition requirement and are paying the registration fee to continue active enrollment while preparing for a preliminary examination.","14":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","15":null,"16":"An immersive approach using authentic communication inside and outside of the classroom will be used to develop introductory communicative skills in American Sign Language. Authentic materials from diverse sources will provide an overview of the American Deaf community. Basic media literacy skills will be taught.

If SIGN 0100 was taken for credit then this course must be taken for credit; if taken as an audit, this course must also be taken as an audit. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by both the academic department and the Committee on Academic Standing.","18":"This course will use an immersive approach incorporating authentic communication to develop intermediate communicative skills in American Sign Language. Through authentic materials from diverse sources, students will engage in classroom discussion and produce media to explore Deaf cultural topics related to family dynamics, language and literacy, and education. Prerequisite SIGN 0200 or placement interview. Additional 1 hour session held through Zoom every week to discuss cultural topics.","19":"Intensive use of expressive and receptive skills in complex grammatical structures, advanced classifiers, dialogues, and storytelling techniques. Discussion of social factors that give rise to code-switching; regional and ethnic sign variations; social, political, and cultural evolution of U.S. Deaf community. Interaction with Deaf community in directed and non-directed activities. Prerequisite SIGN 0300 or placement interview. Additional 1 hour session held through Zoom every week to discuss cultural topics.","20":"This courses increases American Sign Language skills by introducing advanced vocabulary and grammar in various registers and settings, including informal and formal discussions, presentations, and storytelling. Through authentic materials from diverse sources, students will explore American Sign Language literature and oral traditions. Prerequisite SIGN 0400 or placement interview. Additional 1 hour session held through Zoom every week to discuss cultural topics.","21":"Diving into global debates, surround gender, sex, migration, and labor, this course considers forms of work that are inflected by race, gender, class, nation, and ability. Our course title, “7 Hours and 55 Minutes,” draws its inspiration from an advocacy game developed by the Empower Foundation, Thailand’s first sex worker rights organization. The game asks participants to consider Thai sex worker understandings an of sex work, within the context of an 8 hour working day. It examines how the global legal and civilian regulation of gendered bodies is met with vital forms of resistance and community organizing. Each week, our seminar will explore one book, article, documentary film, cultural artifact, or the mixed media artistic productions.","22":"Charting an interdisciplinary path, this course will teach students literary and visual analysis through fiction, film, comics, and graphic novels to explore debates in the 20th and 21st century around how to read blackness. What is the relationship between the history of African Americans and the speculative genre? What tools does it afford African American writers and artists that other genres of fiction do not? How does Black science fiction in both literary and visual form, teach us how to see and read blackness otherwise? Key artists include George Schuyler, W.E.B. DuBois, N.K. Jemison, Janelle Monae, Octavia Butler, among others.","23":"What is the relationship between bodies, violence, and liberation? When Black and brown bodies have historically been sites of colonial and gendered violence, what does it mean to center the body as a site of knowledge production? This course draws upon the emergent performance and aesthetic practices as disruptions of colonial violence; and their relationship to racialized, gendered, and sexual power dynamics. This course will deeply consider what it means to be (in)human, erotic reconfigurations of being, and fugitive practice. We will draw from frameworks in performance studies, Black feminism, women of color feminism, and queer theory to understand the body as a living archive of memory, violence, and liberation. Such attention to performance and aesthetic practices entail not only histories of conquest and genocide, but the creative and life-bearing practices that transcend these conditions of captivity and loss.","24":"Surveys the history of American medicine in its social and political contexts, including changing understandings of disease, treatment practices, and medical institutions. Focuses on how gender and race have informed how patients and healers have made sense out of pain and disease.","25":"This course explores how Black writers and artists represent and theorize a diverse array of Black genders and sexualities. We will begin with a series of conversations on the origins of Black queer theory, and then use these conversations to anchor us in our readings of Black queer life in literary and popular culture. Reading across a range of genres, including film, music, poetry, comics, and short fiction, we will collectively consider the ways sex, gender, and sexuality work with other markers of difference and social status such as race, class, ability, and nationality to demarcate possibilities, freedoms, choices, and opportunities available to Black people. We will learn from theorists, writers, and artists including Audre Lorde, Cathy Cohen, E. Patrick Johnson, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Danez Smith, Janelle Monae, among many others.","26":"This course focuses on the relationship between popular culture, media, and society and provides an overview of social structures, content, audiences, and effects. The core mission of this class is to connect popular culture to the larger world in which it is produced and consumed. We examine the institutional and social contexts of cultural production and consumption in the United States. We will cover a variety of cultural forms (e.g. music, film, tv, and social media) and explore culture as an arena of conflict and a vehicle for social change. Other areas of focus include the meaning of aesthetics and style in daily life, cultural gatekeeping, and the role of social media platforms in shaping the production, distribution, and consumption of cultural texts\/commodities.","27":"This seminar offers a critical and comparative exploration of American music genres that operate as &quot;heritage music&quot; or &quot;ethnic music&quot; in the context of American multiculturalism. We will collectively investigate how musical practice and related discourse can construct, express, perpetuate, and sometimes challenge various cultural identities, community affiliations, and political ideologies. We will particularly attend to public performance contexts, including music festivals, club dancefloors, and live-streaming\/archived online performances. Case studies focus on rural Southern &quot;folk&quot; genres, Chicago blues and house, Asian American taiko ensembles, and norteño\/tejano dance musics (from huapango to Selena). Readings draw on historical and ethnographic scholarship grounded in critical heritage studies and critical race theory. Limited to junior-year American Studies and Ethnic Studies concentrators.","28":"This class examines the issues of Native American identity, primarily in the United States. The course will begin by studying historical tribal organization and classification, and the factors that have led to contemporary stereotypes and ideas of what constitutes an “Indian,” and the factors that have damaged the strength and identity of Native communities over centuries. We will discuss how misconceptions have impacted media portrayals and the American understanding of when, where, and how Native people live. The final portion of the class will discuss self-identity and self-determination through a variety of areas such as tribal enrollment, academia, and media. This course is an American Studies\/Ethnic Studies Junior Seminar and is open to AMST, ETHN, and CNAIS concentrators in their junior year. Other students may register with instructor permission.","29":"This seminar is for second-semester junior American Studies and Ethnic Studies concentrators who are interested in writing an honors thesis in their senior year. The outcome of this course will be a proposal for the honors thesis along with a bibliography and a research plan and schedule. Topics covered will be the research methods associated with different disciplines; how to make the thesis interdisciplinary; integrating public projects and new media into a thesis. Open to juniors concentrating in American Studies and Ethnic Studies. Enrollment limited to 20. S\/NC","30":"Form Matters is an advanced seminar in reading contemporary short fiction, mainly centered on US writers. The class particularly focuses on socially-attuned and historically-minded neo-formalist analyses of literature. Fiction readings will be supplemented with relevant critical readings from both scholars and practicing writers. Students will be expected to engage in rigorous discussion of the material. Goals of the course include introducing you to a relevant critical vocabulary for discussing form, deepening your familiarity with contemporary US short fiction, and improving your oral and written communication skills.","31":"Students explore material culture, its impact upon the environment in the US prior to Industrial Revolution and examine the relationship of this earlier production to current issues of pollution and climate change. In the 18-19th centuries, houses, furniture, whale products were staples of American craft and ingenuity. This material culture tells the story of how gathering raw materials and converting them into usable products came at a severe cost to watersheds, forests, species, humans. These examples show that the seemingly insatiable human urge to control\/transform resources into items for consumption leads to serious consequences for the earth’s climate and inhabitants.","32":"This course examines how the crucible of war has shaped modern conceptions of human nature. Moving from the Civil War to the present, we will consider questions such as changing theories of combat trauma, evolutionary and social scientific explanations for why people fight wars, and the role of memory in individual and collective understandings of violent conflicts. Students will analyze representations of war in film and literature in addition to reading historical and theoretical texts.","33":"This interdisciplinary course explores selected currents in U.S. cultural history from the late nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century. Thematic explorations trace the historical development of American cultural forms and practices, showing how transformations in communications, media, and consumption shaped Americans’ experience of capitalism and market expansion, ideas of self and society, social conflict around questions of race, class, gender, nationalism and empire, as well as immigration, migration, and social movements of both the left and right. Our broad goal will be to understand how culture came to shape how historical change unfolded in this period.","34":"The antebellum African American slave narrative inaugurated Black self-representation in print. Characterized by scholars as neo-slave narratives and, later, post-neo slave narratives, contemporary fictions of US slavery deploy the formal features and thematic concerns of the slave narrative to reveal Black freedom dreams of later periods. Examining recent literary, filmic, and televisual representations of US slavery, this course foregrounds racial slavery in the establishment of longstanding socioeconomic and political asymmetries across race, gender, and class in the US. And it analyzes the ways in which imaginative depictions of racial slavery seek to address and ameliorate such asymmetries. Our class will pay particular attention to how contemporary Black writers and filmmakers thematize labor, love, gender, power, pleasure, community, and resistance among the enslaved and their descendants.","35":"Introduction to American Studies required of all first-year graduate students in American Studies. Graduate students from other departments may enroll with the permission of the instructor.","36":"Since the founding of the United States, we have debated and struggled over the boundaries of American nationhood, who may claim the rights and protections provided by the state, and where the lines of inclusion\/exclusion are drawn. This course will focus on two interrelated themes. The first is the implementation of immigration and nationality controls designed to manage cross-border traffic and restrict membership in the national community. The second is to explore how the projection of US power beyond its territorial borders (e.g. US empire) has fueled cross-border movement between metropole and colonial\/postcolonial zones. We will highlight the ways in which the US’s encroachment of borders outside its territorial domain raises important questions about the meaning and legitimacy of national sovereignty and the fashioning of immigrant “illegality.”","37":"This graduate seminar investigates historical and contemporary technologies and practices of surveillance, drawing on the established field of Surveillance Studies as well as relevant literature in performance studies, media ethnography, software\/platform studies, sociology of labor, and history of science. We will address confluences of moving bodies, disciplining technologies, and state power: for example, motion-sensing systems operating at scales ranging from individual fitness trackers to drone monitoring of refugee movements. Key topics include sousveillance, dataveillance\/data bodies, racialized surveillance, algorithmic bias, surveillance art, and surveillance capitalism.","38":"Interested students must register for HMAN 2401X .","39":"This course explores the mechanics of a doctorate degree in American Studies. We will explore the constitution of our field through the elaboration of field exam lists and narratives, query its pedagogical application in the design of undergraduate syllabi, and begin to outline and enact our participation in the profession both within and beyond the academy. At the end of this class, students will have constructed a portfolio that will assist their progress towards a degree and provide the tools with which to chart pathways once a degree is in hand. S\/NC","40":"This course surveys public humanities work, including cultural heritage preservation and interpretation, museum collecting and exhibition, informal education, and cultural development. It also provides an overview of the contexts of that work in nonprofit organizations, including governance, management, and development.","41":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","42":"Examines from an anthropological perspective efforts to address global poverty that are typically labeled as &quot;development.&quot; The enterprise of development is considered critically, both with regard to the intentions and purposes that underlie the actions of wealthy countries, donor organizations, and expatriate development workers and with regard to the outcomes for the people who are the intended beneficiaries. Privileging the prespectives of ordinary people in developing countries, but also looking carefully at the institutions involved in development, the course relies heavily on ethnographic case studies that will draw students into the complexity of one of the greatest contemporary global problems: social inequality. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.","43":"This course provides an introduction to cultural anthropology, surveying its defining questions, methods, and findings. We will examine the history and utility of anthropology's hallmark method, ethnography, the long-term immersion of the researcher in the culture under study. We will compare cultural anthropology's findings and comportment in other cultures to its conclusions and conduct in our own. No prerequisites.","44":"An introduction to the field of Medical Anthropology. Lecture reading and discussion will examine the social context of health and illness, looking at the diverse ways in which humans use cultural resources to cope with disease and develop medical systems. The course will provide an introduction to the overall theoretical frameworks that guide anthropological approaches to studying human health related behavior. Medical anthropology offers a unique and revealing perspective on the cultural diversity that characterizes human experiences of sexuality, disease, aging, mental illness, disability, inequality and death.","45":"Examination of theory and evidence on human evolution in the past, present and future. Topics include evolution and adaptation, biocultural adaptation, fossil evidence, behavioral evolution in primates, human genetic variation and contemporary human biological variation.","46":"One might say that to be human is to suffer, but what is suffering? Is it to be avoided or embraced? To what ends? The answers to these questions are not just personal or psychological. Rather, they are deeply sociocultural and historical. Orientations toward suffering shape major aspects of life, such as religion, politics, humanitarianism, and medicine. This course explores different ways that society and culture create suffering, and ways that suffering shapes society and culture. This happens not just in suffering itself but also in ways that people try to overcome suffering. Therefore, we also consider the relationship of compassion, empathy and sympathy, and other forms of care to suffering, always paying close attention to questions of the unequal distributions of both suffering and compassion to different groups of people.","47":"This course examines the varying roles of psychoactive substances and altered states of consciousness in both past and present cultural practice. Together, we will critically engage with current archaeological and anthropological research to gain an understanding of how psychoactive substance production and consumption has operated within a myriad of social, ideational, religious, medical, and recreational contexts. Class discussions will cover a diverse range of topics including the use of psychoactive substances in ritual practices; power relations and control over production, distribution, and use; the practical, quotidian applications of psychoactive plants; medicinal applications; and the use of psychoactive substances in social settings. Class discussions will also draw connections to important current issues and topics including addiction &amp; the opioid crisis, recent medical studies &amp; research findings, prohibition &amp; controlled substance classifications, and global legalization movements.","48":"This introduction to the study of language and culture considers how language not only reflects social reality but also creates it. We'll examine specific cases of broad current relevance, in the process learning how an analytical anthropological approach to language use lays bare its often hidden power. We'll consider how language creates and reinforces social inequality and difference, how language promotes and resists globalization, and how language is used creatively in performance, literature, film, advertising, and mass media. We will also consider how language does important social work in specific contexts, such as classrooms, courtrooms, medical settings, and political campaigns.","49":"How has whiteness shaped language—not specific languages or sub-varieties of languages, but the very idea of language itself? This class will not presume either whiteness or language as stable or self-evident categories. Instead, we will explore how both have emerged together in and through projects of (racial, ethnic, gendered, sexual, classed, religious, etc.) colonial modernity. The class will introduce students to a critical interdisciplinary toolkit that they will collaboratively apply to a selection of case studies drawn from global colonial situations, culminating in an original mini-research project.","50":"Language is a site of struggle. What we say, how we say it, and to whom matters. How we hear matters. It can make the difference between life and death. When you hear the news or a teacher talking, do you feel directly addressed? Do you feel like you are a “they” in your classes and in popular discourse? We feel when we are being talked to, talked with, or talked about, and that makes a difference in how we relate to ourselves and each other. In this class, we talk together. We make language and we make space. This class is an experiment in empowerment that comes from using reading in linguistic anthropology to analyze linguistic oppression, appropriation, and exploitation.","51":"Archaeologists study objects and (socio-cultural) anthropologists investigate culture is how stereotype and conventions have long had it. As material culture studies have increasingly blurred these boundaries, the distinction is entirely meaningless when it comes to archaeological heritage. Taking its cue from material culture studies, this course explores how local communities experience the material remains from the past and (re)incorporate them into their contemporary lives.","52":"This course offers an introduction to the concepts and techniques of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Through weekly lab assignments and work on independent projects, students develop skills in cartography and coordinate systems, spatial database design, image processing, basic spatial analysis, hydrological modeling, and three-dimensional modeling. Discussions and case material draw primarily from the application of GIS in archaeology, anthropology, and cultural geography, including the study of archival materials and the ethics of geographic representation. Provides foundation for upper division coursework in spatial analysis. Software focuses on ESRI products (ArcMap, ArcScene, ArcCatalog, ArcGIS Pro).","53":"The purpose of this course is to consider the uses and misuses alcohol, tobacco and drugs, and approaches to recovery from addictions. We will read some of the major cross cultural, ethnographic, linguistic, and social-political works on addictions. Students will conduct their own anthropological interviews regarding substance misuse and recovery as well as observe a local 12 step recovery meeting in the community. Students will engage in discussions of recovery with community partners. Enrollment limited to 20.","54":"Homelessness emerged as a public concern in the United States and in other industrialized countries in the late 1970s as people began encountering people living on the streets, a way of life formerly confined to the skid rows of large cities. In this course, through readings, readings, discussion, and hands on experiences with individuals and families experiencing homelessness, we will uncover the causes, conditions, and responses to homelessness. Each student will spend at least two hours per week in a local homeless-serving community partners in order to gain face to face experiences. The field placements will be facilitated by the professor.","55":"This course explores the distinctive contribution that a critical approach—primarily that of medical anthropology—can make to the rapidly changing field of global health. The course takes a problem-based approach and focuses on “grand challenges,&quot; such as those posed by global pandemics, humanitarian crisis, or the limited reach of child and maternal health programs in “resource-poor” locations. Through ethnographic case studies, we will examine how the concepts and practices associated with global health interventions travel to different parts of the world and interact with local agendas.","56":"This course is part of the Engaged Scholars Program and provides a foundation through which to think about how people’s use of language shapes and is shaped by the medical sphere. Team taught by a linguistic anthropologist (Faudree) and medical anthropologist (Hamdy), this course provides foundations to understanding the scholarly intersections between language, medicine, and society. At the same time, the course offers a strong pragmatic dimension, as students will engage in volunteer and participant-observation work in clinical settings. Throughout the course we will be bringing our insight and observations of clinical practice to bear on anthropological tools of analysis. The course is limited to 20 students who will be admitted to the class via an application process. Priority given to seniors, those in the Engaged Scholars Program, and Anthropology concentrators.","57":"Examines international development from an ethnographic perspective, looking critically at issues of poverty and progress from local points of view. Course is organized around the premise that culture is central to understanding processes of development. Broad development themes such as public health, agriculture, democracy, and the environment will be explored through readings representing a wide range of regions and cultures.","58":"The course explores the ways that archaeologists think about and interpret material culture and provides an opportunity to study the artifacts of everyday life found at historical archaeological sites in the Atlantic World firsthand. Focusing on an assemblage from a site that was a place of intercultural trade, conflict, and enslavement, students will learn how material evidence reveals the entanglements of Indigenous, European, and African people.","59":"Examines death, burial, and memorials using comparative archaeological evidence from prehistory and historical periods. The course asks: What insight does burial give us about the human condition? How do human remains illuminate the lives of people in the past? What can mortuary artifacts tell us about personal identities and social relations? What do gravestones and monuments reveal about beliefs and emotions? Current cultural and legal challenges to the excavation and study of the dead are foregrounded.","60":"Nature and content of Mayan hieroglyphic writing, from 100 to 1600 CE. Methods of decipherment, introduction to textual study, and application to interpretations of Mayan language, imagery, world view, and society. Literacy and Mesoamerican background of script.","61":"More than simply a tissue within our bodies, the human skeleton is a gateway into narratives of the past--from the evolution of our species to the biography of individual past lives. Through lecture and hands-on laboratory, students will learn the complete anatomy of the human skeleton, with an emphasis on the human skeleton in functional and evolutionary perspective. We'll also explore forensic and bioarchaeological approaches to the skeleton. By the course conclusion, students will be able to conduct basic skeletal analysis and will be prepared for more advanced studies of the skeleton from medical, forensic, archaeological, and evolutionary perspectives.","62":"How can we use botanical evidence to understand the past, from cold cases to VERY cold cases? Which roles did plants play in ancient communities? What happens to plant remains after they become incorporated into the archaeological record, and what are the methods used to study these &quot;ecofacts&quot;? How do paleoethnobotanical interpretations contribute to our understanding of history and structure our public policy? How is botanical forensic evidence used in law enforcement investigations? This course trains students in laboratory methods and interpretations of botanical evidence through hands-on practice. We explore the major classes of plant remains likely to be encountered in forensic cases and archaeological sites; identify botanical residues and organize the data to make interpretable results; and address major issues within the discipline.","63":"Bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology have common methodological roots (human osteology) but are oriented to answer very different questions. Both are grounded in the anthropological sub-disciplines of biological anthropology and archaeology. The focus in bioarchaeology is advancing our understanding of the human experience in the past. Bioarchaeologists study a range of topics including health, violence, migration, and embodiment. Forensic anthropology is a form of applied anthropology that is employed to document and interpret human remains in medico-legal contexts. The course will survey both fields while instructing in the methodologies and approaches of each. The course complements The Human Skeleton ( ANTH 1720 ).","64":"Humans make many marks, but it is writing that records, in tangible form, the sounds and meanings of language. Creating scripts is momentous; writing facilitates complex society and is a crucial means of cultural expression. This course addresses the nature of writing in past times. Topics include: the technology of script; its precursors and parallel notations; its emergence, use, and &quot;death&quot;; its change over time, especially in moments of cultural contact and colonialism; writing as a physical object or thing; code-breaking and decipherment, including scripts not yet deciphered; and the nature of non-writing or pseudo- or crypto-scripts.","65":"How is gastronomic heritage established and re-established through ties to ancient foodways? Where do archaeology and history contribute to the ossification and legitimation of culinary traditions and practices? There are many stakes tied to such questions—nutritional, religious, ethnic, institutional, governmental, and touristic, among others. In this course, we address relationships between food history and gastronomic heritage, drawing on examples from around the world and across media, including cookbooks, international policy reports, and video game representations. We examine culinary dimensions considered &quot;traditional&quot; by local communities and federal agencies, the archaeological and historical sources of such narratives (if they exist), and impacts of gastronomic heritage on modern practices, identities, and economies.","66":"This course is a year long two-semester workshop (offered in the fall and spring semesters) for students who are researching and writing an honors or senior thesis in Anthropology or a closely related field.

Prerequisite: One Anthropology course.","68":"This Senior Seminar capstone course is a critical look at the past, present, future of anthropology. The class proceeds from the premise that we must know the history of our field in order to build a stronger discipline. It examines the contributions and missteps of past anthropologists. Among the key questions to address: What are the discipline’s aims and contributions in the 21st century? Has the field successfully integrated diverse voices and perspectives? Are their central theories and methods that have (and continue to) define the field? What does it mean to be an anthropologist?","69":"A seminar exploring fundamental theoretical and ethnographic currents in 20th- and 21st-century cultural anthropology.","70":"A seminar on the methodological problems associated with field research in social and cultural anthropology. Designed to help students prepare for both summer and dissertation research.","71":"This course is designed for third-year graduate students in any subfield of anthropology or closely related fields who are writing grant proposals for dissertation research. Student grant proposals will be pre-circulated and workshopped. Students will gain familiarity with the format for writing successful proposals, with the strategies needed to operationalize them, and with the everyday academic labor of both offering and responding to substantive feedback.","72":"This seminar is for post-field graduate students in residence at Brown who are at any stage of writing their dissertations. It is intended to support dissertators by providing a structured community, providing a setting for sharing goals, and workshopping writing.","73":"What is the relationship between fiction and ethnography, story and fact, creativity and objectivity? This course will consider how fiction and ethnography can each inform yet trouble the other, beginning from the premise that both involve a kind of magic. Using the same building blocks – seemingly humble and ostensibly available to all --writers of fiction and ethnography alike create what one contemporary author has called “language-made hallucinations, fabrications that persuade us to believe in them.” Yet these “fabrications” often have different stakes and use different methods for revealing human “truths.” We’ll explore such divergences and alignments by seeing what is provoked when juxtaposing fiction, ethnography, and even other genres of writing (poetry, journalism, creative non-fiction, etc.). Writing assignments for the course, as befits the content, are flexible with respect to genre.","74":"A seminar devoted to the investigation of the interface of anthropology (especially sociocultural anthropology) and demography. A wide variety of demographic topics-fertility, mortality, marriage, migration-are considered, and the links between anthropological and demographic writings on and approaches to these areas are examined.","75":"This graduate seminar draws on ethnographic studies and social theory to examine the disturbing, but not paradoxical entanglement between law and violence. Building on Charles Tilly’s comparison between state-making and organized crime and Walter Benjamin’s concepts of law-making and law-preserving violence, we will explore how different modes of violence – from brutal force to more nuanced structural and symbolic forms of oppression – intersect with policies and practices of governance. Anthropological approaches will be used to analyze questions of sovereignty, security, and justice, as we will trace their meanings across disjunctive cultural and legal terrains.","76":"Empires — ancient, early modern, and contemporary — have profoundly shaped the distribution of wealth and power in the modern world. However, imperial formations are strikingly diverse, and many of the entities that scholars now call “empires” were not understood as such during their own times. This collaborative humanities graduate seminar explores that diversity and examines how empires rise, fall, and perdure. While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world. We afford particular attention to local peoples' relationships with empires, environmental history, political economy, historiography, and imperial art and material culture.","77":"Examines theoretical and methodological issues in anthropological archaeology. Attention is given to past concerns, current debates, and future directions of archaeology in the social sciences.","78":"An introduction to theoretical and methodological issues in the study of language and social life. We begin by examining semiotic approaches to language. We turn to classical research on language as a structured system - covering such topics as phonology and grammatical categories - but we focus on the implications of such work for broader social scientific and humanistic research. We then consider areas of active contemporary research, including cognition and linguistic relativity, meaning and semantics, pronouns and deixis, deference and register, speech acts and performativity, interaction, verbal art and poetics, reported speech, performance, and linguistic ideology.","79":"How has whiteness shaped language—not specific languages or sub-varieties of languages, but the very idea of language itself? This class will not presume either whiteness or language as stable or self-evident categories. Instead, we will explore how both have emerged together in and through projects of (racial, ethnic, gendered, sexual, classed, religious, etc.) colonial modernity. The class will introduce students to a critical interdisciplinary toolkit that they will collaboratively apply to a selection of case studies drawn from global colonial situations, culminating in an original mini-research project.","80":"For graduate students who have met the tuition requirement and are paying the registration fee to continue active enrollment while preparing for a preliminary examination.","81":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","82":"This first-year seminar explores the impact of data and algorithms on equity and justice.

We will read Virgil’s Aeneid and other major works of Latin literature in translation, consider some of the most canonical works of ancient art and architecture, and place both in the context of broader Roman culture and lived experience. How were the political and cultural changes connected?","350":"What do video vixens and Foxy Brown have in common with &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;? These modern metaphors continue a long history of equating female sexual allure with dangers found in\/or capable of subverting Nature. This course will use contemporary methodologies to make sense of similar descriptions of women found in Greco-Roman literature: how do the Greeks and Romans express a concern about gender, ethnicity, class, and\/or politics using these metaphors? How do these same categories help distinguish what is &quot;natural&quot; from &quot;unnatural&quot;? To what end does this discourse about women and nature affect law, public space, or other aspects of &quot;civilization&quot;?","351":"What is a story? Does it have a life of its own? In this class, we will explore the ancient Greek stories (or “myths”) of creation, Pandora, the Golden Fleece, Hercules, the Trojan War, the Greek goddesses and gods, and many, many more.

And is it possible to separate the “myth” from any particular telling of it? No prerequisites required; all texts in translation.","352":"Introduction to Ancient Roman mythological traditions. Far from simply assimilating Greek myths and changing the names of divinities and heroes, the Romans were highly creative in their adaptation of myths from various other cultures. They had a rich store of myths and legends of their own, including dual foundation stories for Rome itself (Aeneas and the Trojans; Romulus and Remus) as well as mytho-historic tales of exemplary heroes and heroines (e.g. Horatius and Lucretia) whose exploits provided models for future Roman generations. Even obviously flesh-and-blood persons (e.g. Regulus, Hannibal, Caesar, Cleopatra) take on mythical status. We'll focus on the ancient material - literature, art, architecture, religious rituals - with a look as well at the rich reception of Roman mythology in later literature and art. We'll consider also the way the Romans themselves understood – and manipulated – their myths.","353":"Literature gestures us toward a certain kind of knowledge not quite psychological, not quite philosophical. We read widely in the classical and medieval traditions in order to gauge the peculiar nature of what this knowledge tells us about experience and the ways in which expressions of selfhood abide or are changed over time. Authors include but are not limited to Sappho, Pindar, Catullus, Horace, Augustine, and Fortunatus.","354":"This course will explore the reception in colonial Mexico of Cicero's oration 'Pro Archia poeta' (&quot;In defense of Archia the Poet&quot;), with particular emphasis on its use in the colonial schools.

Because of the extensive core knowledge base required to begin exploring the area in depth, the class starts with lectures and readings providing an overview of background material, including definitions\/vocabulary, measurement, neural systems, regulatory processes, and typical experimental paradigms and measures. As the semester progresses, students will pick specific components of the topic for leading seminar sessions\/discussions and preparing a final paper. CLPS 0010 and NEUR 0010 are recommended but not required.","373":"As individuals, we know little. We overestimate our knowledge of common objects and political policies, and the depth of our arguments. But humanity has achieved great things using its mental powers. The most likely reason is that we live in a community of knowledge, guided by shared intentionality. Communities understand how things work, and individuals fail to distinguish what they know from the knowledge that resides in other people's heads. In this course, we will evaluate these claims and discuss how they constrain theorizing in cognitive science. We will draw from literatures in psychology, philosophy, and computer science.","374":"Eye-tracking and pupillometry methods have become increasingly common research tools in psychological research. This laboratory course will provide students with the background knowledge and practical experience to design, execute, and analyze eye-tracking experiments to study cognition. We will explore the behavioral and neural basis of these measures, consider experimental design and methodological issues, and learn methods for data processing and analyses, as well as how to use an eye-tracking system. We will read and discuss primary research articles applying these methods to gain experience in critically evaluating and interpreting results. Students will design a research project using one of these methods, collect and analyze data, give oral presentations, and prepare a written report of their research.","375":"This seminar examines the cognitive changes associated with normal aging and age-related dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease). Topics covered will include changes in the neurocognitive systems mediating memory, perception, and attention. The course is primarily intended as an advanced seminar for junior and senior concentrators in Psychology, but is also intended for other students interested in aging and the neuropsychology of cognition. Recommended prerequisites: An introductory course in cognitive neuroscience ( CLPS 0400 , CLPS 0450 , CLPS 0200 ) or permission of the instructor. CLPS 0900 or a comparable Statistics course is strongly recommended. Preference will be given to senior CLPS concentrators.","376":"In his 1882 treatise on Diseases of Memory, Ribot wrote that “the disorders and maladies of this faculty, when classified and properly understood, are no longer to be regarded as a collection of amusing anecdotes of only passing interest. They will be found to be regulated by certain laws which constitute the very basis of memory and from which its mechanism is easily laid bare.” In that spirit, this seminar will examine how both organic (e.g., Korsakoff syndrome, herpes encephalitis, semantic dementia) and functional (e.g., fugue, posthypnotic amnesia, multiple personality disorder) amnesias can inform our understanding of human memory.","377":"Although the hippocampus is one of the most studied brain structures of the last century, there is still considerable disagreement about its core function. In one view, the hippocampus is essential for forming memories of the unique episodes in our lives. In another, the hippocampus is devoted to spatial navigation, encoding a spatial map of the world and our location in it. Reconciling these viewpoints has posed a significant scientific challenge. This seminar examines differing perspectives on how the hippocampus contributes to cognition and behavior, with the goal of integrating evidence from multiple subfields of psychology and neuroscience.","378":"We explore neural network models that bridge the gap between biology and cognition. Begins with basic biological and computational properties of individual neurons and networks of neurons. Examines specialized functions of various brain systems (e.g., parietal cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, ganglia) and their involvement in various phenomena, including perception, attention, memory, language and higher-level cognition. Includes a lab component in which students get hands on experience with graphical neural network software, allowing deeper appreciation for how these systems work. Prerequisites: CLPS 0040 or CLPS 0200 or NEUR 0010 .","379":"The ecological approach treats perceiving and acting as activities of agent-environment system rather than an isolated \"mind,\" and offers an alternative to the prevailing computational\/representational view. Topics include inferential and direct perception, perception of the 3D environment, visual control of action, dynamics of motor coordination, and self-organization of behavior. Lecture and discussion. Prerequisite (any one of the following): CLPS 0010 ( PSYC 0010 ), CLPS 0020 ( COGS 0010 ), CLPS 0500 (COGS\/ PSYC 0440 ), or CLPS 0510 ( COGS 0110 ).","380":"How does visual stimulation inform the brain about the three-dimensional structure of the world? What information is important for complex organisms, like humans and other primates, to be able to successfully interact with the surrounding environment? In this course we will examine how different sources of visual information such as stereo, contours, texture gradients, shading, and optic flow contribute to the vivid experience of 3D shape by the human visual system. Moreover, connections will be made to the mechanisms that govern goal directed actions, in order to unveil the commonalities between 3D processing for conscious perception and visuomotor mappings.","381":"One of the main purposes of encoding visual information is to perform visually-guided actions to directly interact with the external world. This seminar will shed light on the behavioral and underlying neural mechanisms involved in integrating perception and cognitive processes, and converting them into action. We will also explore how visuo-motor behavior can provide a useful tool to study a wide range of conscious and unconscious cognitive processes including the current locus of attention, the nature of language representation, spatial representation of number, and high-level decision-making. Prerequisite: CLPS 0010 , CLPS 0020 , or NEUR 0010 .","382":"This course will focus on perceptual learning and visual plasticity. The goal of this course is to understand the mechanisms of visual perceptual learning and visual and brain plasticity. Perceptual learning is defined as long-term performance improvement as a result of visual experiences. Enrollment limited to 20.","383":"There has been an explosion of interest in how to present information in a visual way rather than as a bunch of boring numbers. Visualizations can be outstanding at conveying information, but there have also been colossal failures. We will explore the good, the bad, and the ugly and harness knowledge of visual perception to understand why some are more successful than others. Someone interested in how to create effective visual displays (posters, infographics) would benefit from this course. Some background in visual perception is recommended such as a CLPS or NEUR course about vision or familiarity with graphic design.","384":"All normally developing children acquire language, yet there is little agreement about how this takes place. This class explores the course of language acquisition from birth to babbling and first words to the use of complex syntax, discussing philosophical, theoretical, and methodological approaches to the problem. Includes practical experience analyzing child language data. Prerequisite: CLPS 0030 ( COGS 0410 ) or CLPS 0800 ( COGS 0450 ), or permission of the instructor.","385":"How do we learn from other people? If a child was raised in the absence of any social interaction, what cognitive structures would s\/he have? This course will focus on what and how children learn from others, including concepts like language, rituals, religion, biology. Emphasis will also be on \"selective trust\" - whether we learn from all informants equally or are rational in how we learn from others. Prerequisite: CLPS 0600 , 0610 , or 0700 . Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.","386":"Cooperation is essential to a thriving and functioning society. Our everyday lives contain examples of strangers making sacrifices for the benefits of others. For instance, humans donate money, blood, or even a kidney to complete strangers in times of need. That being said, it is hard to ignore that many of the problems we face as a society, such as climate change, remain intractable in part because of individuals' lack of willingness to incur monetary costs to benefit others. This class will explore the ways in which humans are and are not cooperative beings. We will do this through a developmental lens with an emphasis on understanding how cooperative impulses can be traced to behaviors in childhood.","387":"The study of anxiety, stress, and neurotic disorders, psychosomatic disorders, deviant social behavior, affective disorders, and schizophrenia. Considers theories of etiology (causes) and methods of therapeutic treatment, case studies, experimental research, and clinical research.","388":"This seminar is designed to provide an overview of the goals and practices of psychological assessment across the lifespan. We will examine different domains of psychological assessment (e.g., clinical and diagnostic evaluations, cognitive testing, risk assessment), discussing the theoretical and empirical bases for these practices. We will discuss real world applications, with a particular emphasis on the field of clinical psychology. Students will be exposed to a variety of measures (e.g., interviews, surveys, cognitive tasks) and learn basic assessment skills and procedures. Students are expected to read and comment on course readings, participate in weekly discussions and group work, and complete writing assignments and exams throughout the semester.","389":"The goal of this course is to explore emerging themes at the intersection of psychological science, business, and behavioral economics. Psychologists are primarily interested in detecting limits to human rationality, whereas economics tends to proceed within the rational-actor model. In business, questions arise of how theoretical models and empirical findings related to the practice of managerial decision-making. Investigations of power and the psychological impact of money are relatively recent additions to the suite of research topics. New methodologies, such as neuro-imaging have led to advances not represented in the traditional framework of organizational psychology. Enrollment limited to 20 junior and senior Psychology and Behavioral Decision Making concentrators.","390":"This course will provide an overview of the field of social neuroscience, and in particular how the subfields of neuroeconomics and political psychology interact. We will consider how social processes are implemented at the neural level, but also how neural mechanisms help give rise to social phenomena and cultural experiences, such as political polarization. Many believe that the large expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with social others—competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. In this course, we will review core principles, theories, and methods guiding neuroeconomics, and leverage these tools and theories to better understand our current political landscape and polarized attitudes. Overall, this course will introduce students to a multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context, through the lens of neuroeconomics,","391":"This course will introduce students to the field of moral psychology, which lies at the intersection of social and cognitive psychology and connects to many other disciplines, from sociology and philosophy to anthropology and law. With an introductory lecture and a discussion seminar each week, students will learn about the broad territory of moral phenomena, from its foundations in norms and values to moral judgments and moral behavior, from considerations of moral emotions and character to forms of moral communication and moral sanctions. Course requirements include exams, work in reading teams, short presentations, seminar contributions, and a final paper.","392":"How do we learn to cooperate, help others in need, and appropriately respond after being treated unfairly? The human mind strives to resolve the competing pressures of self-interest against the greater good. By drawing upon many disciplines including philosophy, social and affective neuroscience, abnormal psychology, law, and experimental economics, this course covers topics from 18th-century philosophy to modern-day neuroscience. We will examine 1) the philosophical and epistemological foundations of moral thought, 2) the influence of emotion and contextual framing on moral action, 3) the psychopathology of immoral choice, and 4) the underlying cognitive and neurobiological processes that guide moral decision-making. Registration for this course will be determined by the faculty on the first day of class. The final class list is determined by 1) some working knowledge in cognitive neuroscience (evidence by taking at least 1 prior class in the concentration), 2) who shows up to the first class, 3) the student's year (seniority is prioritized) and 4) when people emailed the faculty member to get on the class list.","393":"This seminar focuses on empirical research ranging across several topics in the psychology of prejudice, stereotyping, discrimination, and social stigma. We will read, interpret, and discuss quantitative research in social psychology (i.e., studies that contain statistics in their results) and the implications of these scholarly contributions to our knowledge of the inner workings of intergroup behavior. This includes understanding individual differences and contexts related to exhibiting prejudicial behaviors (prejudice\/bias), the implications of this behavior for targets of discrimination (stigma), and contributions of each of these to how groups and group members interact with one another in society (intergroup relations).","394":"Examines principles of experimental design and analysis in the context of classic and contemporary research in social cognition. Students replicate and extend several studies on topics such as person perception, social stereotyping, or judgment and decision making. Students will participate in the design of these studies, gather their own data, analyze them, and report the findings in oral presentations and written reports. Prerequisites: CLPS 0010 ( PSYC 0010 ), CLPS 0700 ( PSYC 0210 ), and CLPS 0900 (PSYC\/ COGS 0090 ). Enrollment limited to 24.","395":"This course will examine the neural systems underlying language and its parts – sounds, words, sentences, and meaning. We will examine effects of brain injury on speaking and understanding in individuals with left hemisphere injury, right hemisphere injury, and with the two hemispheres split. We will also study brain plasticity by examining recovery of language in aphasia and the effects on language when there is deprivation to areas of the brain specialized for hearing in the deaf and seeing in the blind. Behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence will be investigated in those with and without brain injury. Prerequisites: one of the following – CLPS0010, CLPS0300, CLPS0450, NEUR0010.","396":"This course is designed to provide CLPS concentrators (psychology\/cognitive science\/cognitive neuroscience) with a variety of tools needed to conduct research: sources of data, standard designs (e.g., factorial experimental, correlational, longitudinal), research ethics, and best practices of literature review (e.g., meta-analysis). The course will include lectures, laboratory exercises, data collection, statistical analysis, and presentation of findings in written and oral reports. (Previously CLPS 1091 )","397":"This course is designed to provide CLPS concentrators (Cognitive Science\/ Cognitive Neuroscience\/Psychology) with a variety of tools needed to conduct research: sources of data, standard experimental designs, and research ethics. The course will include lectures, section meetings, data collection, statistical analyses, and written and oral reports. This is a flipped course with content material (lectures) available as videos to be viewed before class meetings. Course includes one 80-min lecture meeting and one 80-min lab section each week, and students are expected to attend both. This course is enrollment capped at 60 students.","398":"This is the capstone course for the Behavioral Decision Sciences (BDS) concentration. It entails a research project that serves as a culmination of each student’s experience within the concentration. Students should choose a research topic compatible with the three electives that they have taken or will take as part of the concentration. They will also need a faculty advisor for the project. The course entails presentation of your ideas and plans, as well as your final results.","399":"This course is the first of a two-course sequence that provides graduate students with background in the core topics and themes in the cognitive and psychological sciences. Topics include sensory systems, perception, action, evolution and development, phonetics and phonology, attention, learning, memory, and executive function. Students are also introduced to a wide range of approaches and levels of analysis that scientists adopt to study these topics. Weekly topics are addressed in lectures and assigned readings. A separate seminar session involves presentation of current papers by students and discussion with faculty. Open to graduate students only.","400":"For graduate students who have met the tuition requirement and are paying the registration fee to continue active enrollment while preparing for a preliminary examination.","401":"This course lays the foundation of graduate-level statistics concepts for all Ph.D. students in the CLPS Department. The course covers the basic multivariate techniques currently used in social and cognitive sciences: multiple regression, factorial and mixed between\/within ANOVA, MANOVA, and linear approaches to categorical data analysis. The course does not cover mixed-effects (multi-level) analysis, covariance structure analysis (PCA, FA, SEM), or Bayesian statistics. The minimum prerequisite statistics knowledge assumed for the course will be undergraduate statistics, as covered in CLPS 0900 or comparable courses. Thus, the course assumes knowledge of such basics as point estimates, confidence intervals, normal distributions, hypothesis testing, t tests, univariate linear regression, and one-way ANOVA. Students will have assigned readings, attend lectures, complete weekly homeworks, and write two take-home exams.","402":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","403":"Explores the origins, performance, reception, adaptation, and translation of the 1001 Nights , one of the most beloved and influential story collections in world literature. We will spend the semester in the company of genies, princes, liars, slaves, mass murderers, orientalists, and Walt Disney, and will consider the Nights in the context of its various literary, artistic, and cinematic afterlives.","404":"Examines the narrative of detection, beginning with the great dramatic whodunit (and mystery of identity) Oedipus Rex . Literary texts which follow a trail of knowledge, whether to establish a fact (who killed Laius?) or reveal an identity (who is Oedipus?) follow in Sophocles' footsteps. We read Sophocles' intellectual children. Readings include: Hamlet , The Murders in the Rue Morgue , The Woman in White , and other classic novels and plays. We also analyse seminal films of the genre, including Laura and Vertigo . Will include the twentieth-century detective story, with particular attention to women writers and the genre of the female private eye.","405":"This course offers an introduction to Third-Worldist thought and literature, focusing on the shifting relationship between the Soviet Union, anticolonial nationalist movements, and leftist internationalist currents during the years 1955-1973. How did literature contribute to the formation of the Third-Worldist project, and how did the Third-Worldist project inform the writing of literature? We will approach these questions by examining the role of conferences, print periodicals, and supranational organizations like the Afro-Asian Writers Association in shaping new understandings of the politicized function of literature. At the same time, we will pay close attention to the aesthetic categories and literary forms that mediated a powerful sense of solidarity between far-flung revolutionary actors.","406":"When are reading and writing dangerous activities? Who gets to decide? And what are the consequences, for individuals and societies? In this seminar, we will explore works of fiction, poetry, autobiography and children’s literature that have been banned, redacted or put on trial in the modern period; and think critically about the ideas of decency, protection and security that underlie such censorship. As we consider the role book bans play in public life today, we will explore anti-censorship practices in the arts, journalism, law and grassroots advocacy.","407":"Examines reincarnations of the Homeric figure of Odysseus in contemporary literatures and film as modernist figure, postcolonial subject, and existentialist hero. How is the Odysseus myth altered from culture to culture (Greece, Rome, Ireland, the Caribbean)? How is it re-visioned in different historical periods and from different perspectives (feminist, marxist, postcolonial) and genres (epic, poetry, the novel, film, drama)? Major authors include Homer, Virgil, Tennyson, Joyce, Kazantzakis, Cavafy, Seferis, Atwood, Walcott; criticism by Bakhtin, Edith Hall, Adorno, Derrida. Films include works by Angelopoulos, the Coen brothers; Singer’s Usual Suspects, Mendes’ James Bond offering Skyfall, and Kubrick’s 2001: Space Odyssey.","408":"What is imitation (sincerest form of flattery) to literary canons? Vergil’s Aeneid appropriated Aeneas from the Iliad , Joyce’s Ulysses modernized the Odyssey . Admiration as a source of inspiration is a major force in the evolution of fiction. ”Fan Fiction” explores intriguing characters in greater detail and new contexts, allowing them new lives in contemporary imagination. This course presents pairs or sets of works that are explicitly linked by the intimate relation of imitation. Classic readings will be paired with their mostly contemporary updates, including Pride and Prejudice\/Murder at Pemberley , Heart of Darkness\/State of Wonder , and Monkey\/Tripmaster Monkey .","409":"Material extraction, forced religious conversion, and physical brutality were but a few of the oppressive acts imposed on the Indigenous populations of the Americas by Western colonialism. However, those under Iberian and British Rule—in Peru, Mexico and New England—found ways to resist and negotiate the terms of domination by adopting, and therefore adapting, European forms and norms. This class takes an interdisciplinary approach that combines historiography, literature, and art, to analyze the mechanisms of Indigenous resistance within the developing structures of colonialism: race, religion, geography, and gender. We will read a variety of texts that originate from Aztec, Inca, Algonquian, Spanish, Brazilian, and British contexts. All readings available in English, but students are welcome to read any in the original language.","410":"One of Shakespeare’s greatest plays is about a character who was an irredeemable failure: Coriolanus. What can failure teach us? What kind of strength does a language of failure possess? We will read the ancient sources themselves (Livy, Lucian, Plutarch), and modern adaptations of these stories (Bertolt Brecht, T. S. Eliot, Günter Grass). We will also look at other “exemplary” failures who inspired Shakespeare and later literature, including Lucullus and Timon.","411":"This course will study the emergence of the modern concept of happiness from the ancient ideal of the &quot;good life&quot; to the notion of &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; as an &quot;inalienable right.&quot; We will trace the development of this concept in the early modern period and read representations of the search for happiness in a variety of literary, philosophical, and political texts (including the American and the Haitian Declarations of Independence and the French Declaration of Rights). Readings will include oriental and fairly tales, novels, and essays (by Mme d'Aulnoy, Mme du Chatelet, Montesquieu, Johnson, Fielding, Voltaire, and Rousseau, among others). Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.","412":"Paradise, periphery, or prison? The representation of the island has been described as imaginary and not actual, mythological and not geographical. Examines the fascination with islands in the western cultural imaginary. Selective readings from literature, film and historical texts focus on ways in which island spaces have been represented in diverse social, national, imperial contexts as well as the effect of such projections on the native islanders, their visitors and often subjugators. Authors may include Homer, Plato, Marco Polo, Mandeville, Darwin, Defoe, Tournier, Kincaid, Kafka, Durrell, Seferis; theoretical works drawn from critical geography, postcolonialism, and the field of island studies.","413":"What do race and ethnicity mean to regions outside Europe and North America? How did the perceptions of different physiological and cultural features define premodern and modern East Asia? Since when and for what reasons did some people, whom Marco Polo considered “white,” become racially Asian or yellow in literary and cinematic representations? This survey course will demystify East Asian homogeneity and discuss how various literary, cinematic, and critical works from antiquity up to the modern era present notions and issues related to race and ethnicity in the region now known as East Asia. The reading material will include excerpts from The Zuo Tradition, The Travels of Marco Polo, Bai Juyi, Min Jin Lee, Orientalism, and others. The course will be taught in English, and no prior knowledge of Asian cultures or languages is required.","414":"Using the theoretical framework of the Anthropocene, this course considers a wide array of aesthetic codes—from Ovidian elegy and Shakespearean tragicomedy to zombie narrative and postcolonial ghost stories—to investigate how distinct cultural forms contest, recast, and, at times, reinstate the (often-hierarchical) boundaries between human and nature, human and animal, and human and human. Through a sampling of poetry, narrative, and film, we will explore the uneven terrain of the Anthropocene, in which the feedback loops of race, class, gender, and other forms of social difference, along with geography itself, continue to separate humans, even as evidence mounts for the inseparability of humans from the rest of the planet, including its nonhuman inhabitants. Course materials will be provided in English and include works from Ishirō Honda, Octavia Butler, Colson Whitehead, Tommy Orange, J.M. Coetzee, and Bong Joon-Ho, among others.","415":"&quot;I didn't draw any people,&quot; Kafka once wrote, &quot;I told a story. Those are pictures, only pictures...one takes photographs of things in order to forget them. My stories are a way of closing my eyes.&quot; Kafka's sentences invite us to reflect upon the relationship between literature, photography, and philosophical thought—from the first heliograph in 1826 and the inception of the daguerreotype in 1839 to the digital image of today. Taking as our point of departure the relation of literature and &quot;light-writing,&quot; we will address selected issues in the historical and conceptual interaction among word, image, and critical thought. Our wager: texts and photographic images share a common relationship to time, desire, death, mourning, and politics. Writers may include Kafka, Proust, Benjamin, Kracauer, Barthes, Heidegger, and Derrida. Images by photographers including August Sander and Andrew Moore. Students from diverse fields welcome.","416":"An historical introduction to problems of literary theory from the classical to the postmodern. Issues to be examined include mimesis, rhetoric, hermeneutics, history, psychoanalysis, formalisms and ideological criticism (questions of race, gender, sexuality, postcolonialism). Primarily for advanced undergraduates. Lectures, discussions; several short papers.","417":"The course introduces students to cross-cultural comparative work, and to critical issues in East-West studies in particular. We will base our conversations on a set of texts related to the interconnected histories and hybrid cultures of the ancient Afro-Eurasian Silk Roads. Readings will include ancient travel accounts (e.g., the Chinese novel Journey to the West, Marco Polo); modern fiction and film (e.g., Inoue Yasushi, Wole Soyinka); and modern critical approaches to the study of linguistic and literary-cultural contact (e.g., Lydia Liu, Emily Apter, Mikhail Bakhtin, Edward Said). Topics will include bilingual texts, loanwords, race and heritage, Orientalism. No prior knowledge of the topic is expected and all texts will be available in English.","418":"Explores the 19th-century Arabic cultural renaissance known as the Nahda. Topics include intellectual encounters between Europe and the Middle East, the birth of the Arabic novel, and the rise of Islamic modernism. We will read selections from the works of Shidyaq, Tahtawi, Zaydan, Shawqi, Bustani, and others, alongside historiographical and theoretical texts. At least three years of Arabic required.","419":"Interested students must register for FREN 1020B .","420":"James Joyce’s Ulysses (Ireland, 1922), André Breton’s Nadja (Paris, 1928), and Julio Cortázar’s Hopscotch (Argentina, 1963): key texts of modernism, the avant-garde, and post-modernism, from different moments and outpost of literary modernity, but in intimate conversation with one another about the place of the human in art, and of art in politics. Join Stephen Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom, Nadja, Horacio Oliveira, and a cast of minor characters on a journey through the hearts, minds, memories, and nervous systems of various modern metropoles.","421":"This course invites students to explore the pleasurable challenges of close reading within the context of a compressed form, the modern short story. Select works from the nineteenth century on wards—many of them masterpieces, some hidden gems from around the world—will help us question what we think they mean and how we know this. We will develop practices and techniques for articulating such quandaries even as we observe how sociocultural themes, theories of interpretation, and literary movements intertwine with expressions of the self and the politics of identity. No prerequisites. Open to all undergraduates.","422":"The fifty years between the Second World War and the formation of the European Union was a period in which the meaning of \"Europe\" was placed under great strain. The class will examine the strains and debates about Europe within the lyric poetry of several literary traditions. It will take the form of close historical, formal, and critical readings of three books of poems in their entirety: Montale's The Storm and Others (1956), Celan's No-One's Rose (1963), and Hill's Canaan (1997). Enrollment limited to 25.","423":"Hating on poetry is a time-honored tradition. From Plato to the Dadaists, thinkers and writers across the world have questioned the reigning poetics, or the value of poetry altogether. This course examines a range of theoretical arguments about the value and nature of poetry from the premodern period to the present. At the same time, we will closely read materials from literary projects that have explored the permissible limits of the poetic, defined themselves against poetry, or have been accused of failing to meet the standards of poetry. Focusing on case studies like the Latin American anti-poetry movement, the Arabic prose poem and the work of the LANGUAGE poets, we will familiarize ourselves with debates in lyric theory and a variety of poetic traditions.","424":"Listening is not only the supposedly peaceful, welcoming activity that verges on mere receptive passivity. Listening or not listening also has to do with the exercise of power and this is the reason why we have a responsibility as listeners. In order to explore what could be described as the politics of listening, we will follow multiple paths that will lead us from the strategies of listening in concert venues to the medical practice of auscultation and the generalization of surveillance techniques. Our seminar will interweave readings in literature or theory (Kafka, Nietzsche, Calvino, Foucault, Chekhov, Freud, Deleuze. . .) and screenings of selected filmic scenes.","425":"The primary focus of this course is the practice of literary translation as an art. Using the workshop format, each student will complete a project by the end of the semester. Examples and theoretical texts will illuminate the historical, ethical, cultural, political, and aesthetic values that underlie every translation, keeping an eye towards opening up the field beyond inherited practices to consider the contemporary implications of our choices, intentions, and purposes in translation. Open to all levels. Heritage speakers are welcome, collaboration is permitted, and an open-spirited approach to this developing and fascinating practice is strongly recommended.","426":"How the historical fiction that has flourished over the past four decades challenges the notions of objectivity and totalization, while providing alternative viewpoints for the reconstruction and reinterpretation of the past. Authors considered include Grass, Doctorow, Delillo, García-Márquez, Allende, Danticat and Gordimer. Theoretical texts by White, LaCapra, Benjamin, Ricoeur, and Chartier. Films such as The Official Story and Europa, Europa will be viewed and incorporated into the discussions. Prerequisite: two previous courses in literature. Enrollment limited to 19. Instructor permission required.","427":"In the early years of the twentieth century, a series of artistic movements rippled across the Western hemisphere, exploding conceptions of art and culture while reconfiguring international relations. Explores those movements, from their predecessors (Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé), through overlapping –isms (Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, Vorticism, Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism), to avatars in the Americas. In keeping with the avant-garde's cross-pollinating spirit, we study texts from a variety of traditions, forms, and genres: from poetry through prose to manifestoes, from painting and photography to film, music, and dance, touching on questions of translation and translatability between languages, cultures, and art-forms. Enrollment limited to 25.","428":"In this course we will study problems of remembering and forgetting in a variety of texts including poetry, philosophy, psychoanalysis, memoirs, public monuments, memory studies and trauma theory. We will explore the roles of language and representation in dealing with the past, the temporality of the self, the operation of the unconscious, the memorial and the monument. We will also look at the politics of memory in relation to the cultural traumas of slavery, the Holocaust, Viet Nam and 9\/11. Readings from Rousseau, Hegel, Wordsworth, Proust, Derrida and de Man; Freud, Caruth, Saidiya Hartman, Segalen; Arendt and Reznikoff.","429":"In 1921 Walter Benjamin was working simultaneously on three significant and interrelated essays: “Toward the Critique of Violence,” “The Task of the Translator,” and “Goethe’s Elective Affinities.” The seminar will focus on this set of writings as providing insights into Benjamin’s criticism as a whole. After examining closely Benjamin’s essays on violence and on translation we will read Goethe’s novel and Benjamin’s study of it using the new translation and critical edition, Writings on Goethe (Stanford University Press), that will be appearing at the end of this year. Works will be read and discussed in English with attention to the German (seminar participants with knowledge of German are encouraged to read the texts in the original language).","430":"Study and practice of translation as art and a potent form of literary criticism. Translation is an act of interpretation, which informs the language of the translator and the text as a whole: context, intent, and language. Discussion will include the impact of cultural difference, tone and time on translation, and the role of analytical as well as intuitive understanding of the original in the translator's endeavor.","431":"Interested students must register for HMAN 2402D .","432":"Interested students must register for HISP 2351E .","433":"Interested students must register for LATN 2090I .","434":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","435":"Removes the mystery surrounding computers and the ever-growing digital world.

The sacred syllable OM, now a global symbol of Eastern spirituality, exemplifies the power and authority of mantra. What are mantras? What do they accomplish? How do they shape identities, beliefs, and practices? Engaging with sacred utterance in various media, this course explores the world of mantras in India and beyond.","533":"Who are we? How do we fit in the universe? Like many other systems of thought around the world, the Daoist tradition approached these questions both through the creation of texts, teachings, and theory, and through the development of at times extremely complex embodied contemplative practices. Starting from a perspective of a person not as a unitary, monolithic entity, but rather as a composite of energies and influences, these practices seek to harmonize, balance, and transform the person. This course will explore how the possibilities of personal transformation were expressed in Daoist contemplative literature from the first centuries CE up to the modern day. Contemplative practice labs will also offer students an opportunity to explore the ideas in the texts through direct experience.

We will start with Christian allegorical texts (Dr. Faustus and Pilgrim's Progress ), complicate the picture with 19th century psychological fiction, and conclude with some masterpieces of art cinema.","877":"Many works of literature send their characters on far-flung journeys, separating them from their homes. Can one, though, be at home even far away from home? What can we learn about the notion of &quot;home&quot; and identity from those exiled from the place they know as home? What becomes visible when viewing the world from a new perspective? And what cultural norms do such stories explore, challenge, and\/or re-enforce. Possible readings: Kindred, Exit West, and How Much of These Hills is Gold.","878":"What do we mean when we call a novel realistic? When did the term first start being used, and why? This class attempts to answer these questions by studying the emergence of realism as the dominant literary form in the late nineteenth century, reading the work of writers such as Henry James, Thomas Hardy, Stephen Crane, Edith Wharton, and Charles Chesnutt. Our aim will be to develop a working definition of realism, and to understand why it proved such an appealing genre. In the process we will touch upon some of the major intellectual and social developments of the period, such as Darwin’s theory of evolution, Freud’s theory of the unconscious, the rise of the mass media, the triumph of consumerism, mass immigration, and the system of Jim Crow segregation.","879":"This course examines U.S. culture of the 1920s, with particular attention to phenomena that came to be mythologized as the “roaring twenties”—flappers, movie culture, literary and cultural innovation, primitivism and exoticism. We will read fiction and some poetry in the context of movies, publicity, and advertising. Class discussion will focus on analyzing texts with an attention to language and form, as well as connecting these texts to their cultural contexts. Enrollment limited to 19 first-year students.","880":"People just can't seem to stop turning medieval literature into movies. Why? And more importantly-- how? What is being created when Dev Patel's Gawain wanders through the fog in an oversized scarf, or when Aubrey Plaza's Sister Fernanda waves around a hand axe while screaming at the top of her lungs? In this course, we will read selected highlights from 1000 years of literary history from the European Middle Ages, watch films based (with varying degrees of looseness) on those texts, and explore what it means to adapt something. Along the way, we will learn how to read literature, how to watch movies, and how to think about adaptations beyond the limiting notion of &quot;faithfulness.&quot; No previous knowledge of the Middle Ages necessary. Films may contain explicit content.","881":"Stories begin with the sea: Jason and the Argonauts, Sinbad and the Seven Seas, Odysseus trying to sail home. Modern narrative, in turn, finds one of its crucial settings on board ships: Ahab’s quest to kill the white whale in Moby Dick, Jim’s crisis of self in Lord Jim. This class reads these works in the context of a number of other texts set at sea, the place of ‘tall tales,’ of adventure, sometimes of terror, but also of industrial labor, modern commerce, and racial conflict. Our aim will be to explore how fiction works both on the level of individual sentences and paragraphs and on the level of narrative, character, and plot.","882":"This course will study the Victorian period through the lens of the writer with whom it is most closely associated in the popular imagination: Charles Dickens. We will read a selection of Dickens’s writing and consider them in the context of important developments during this time, including the emergence of modern city life, capitalism, and serial and popular literature.","883":"Today, the word “austerity” is strongly associated with harsh economic policies that force people to live with less. But what if a person voluntarily embraces an austere lifestyle? In this course, we will consider the figure of the ascetic—an individual who leads a life of severe self-discipline and restraint—across an expansive range of literature from the Global Anglophone, such as Frankenstein, In the Castle of My Skin, Nervous Conditions, The Inheritance of Loss, and Normal People. Why would an individual place such demanding restrictions on their everyday life, and what new perspectives could the extremities of asceticism provide on our own lives?","884":"This course introduces students to textual, visual, and filmic experiments by Asian and Asian diaspora writers and artists. Instead of reading memoirs and realist novels, we will consider how these artists explore forms like short stories, performance, graphic novels, and films, as well as genres like science fiction, horror, mystery, and romance. This course’s focus on speculative and unsettling forms of storytelling will expand our understanding of Asian and Asian diaspora artistry and recast themes of immigration, alienation, belonging, grief, memory, and identity. “What if?” is an important question these storytellers ask; “What if&quot; is a type of creativity we will investigate by close reading these recent experiments at the limits of storytelling. Texts include short and feature-length films and fiction by Haruki Murakami, Karen Tei Yamashita, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ling Ma, and Charles Yu. No prerequisites.","885":"How have dreams of freedom been written in the 20th and 21st centuries?

Coetzee, NoViolet Bulawayo, Derek Walcott, Layli Long Soldier, Dionne Brand, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha), plus a graphic novel (Thi Bui) and a film (Saint Omer, dir. Alice Diop).","886":"What cause do we have to remember? How humans engage with and conceive of the past has been the focus of philosophical and literary study for thousands of years.

Throughout this course, we will discuss the influences of memory on individual and collective levels by studying an assortment of poetry, novels, drama, and film. Readings will include texts by William Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, Ilya Kaminsky, and Emily St. John Mandel. No previous experience with literary scholarship necessary.","887":"The Preamble begins thus: “We the People of the United States …” How was this “we” conceptualized at the nation’s birth, and how has it changed? How do we imagine and revise the collectivity of the national, racial, cultural, sexual, and social “we” in the 21st century? This course explores what it means to be an individual and inhabit the collective “we” in American literatures that stage the question of the self versus\/and\/or\/with\/against\/through the communal identity. Some authors include Eugenides, Faulkner, Emerson, O’Brien, Morrison, Chang-rae Lee, Silko, Paul Beatty, Alexis Bechdel, and Craig Santos Perez. No prerequisites.","888":"What is racial capitalism?

Texts may include the Roman de Silence, the Lais of Marie de France, and the Book of Margery Kempe. No previous experience with medieval literature required.","890":"We will read a representative selection of Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies, histories, and romances, considering their historical contexts and their cultural afterlife in terms of belief, doubt, language, feeling, politics, and form. Students should register for ENGL 0310A S01 and may be assigned to conference sections by the instructor during the first week of class.","891":"Why does the English department require concentrators to take one course covering writing before the year 1700? What's so magical about 1700? What's so special about literature before that date? The word “literature” in its modern sense doesn’t even emerge until the 18th century (at the earliest). So is what we’re reading when we read pre-1700 material even literature? We'll survey some writing produced--wait for it--before 1700, consider why we're doing so and whether such a requirement makes sense, and read some material about the function and value of the study of literature in English in the first place. Authors may include William Shakespeare, Anne Bradstreet, John Milton, and Aphra Behn.","892":"This course examines a crucial tradition in American letters and culture: the literature of self-examination and the spiritual quest.

S. Naipaul, Jamaica Kincaid, Jean Rhys, Wole Soyinka, Derek Walcott, and Zoë Wicomb.

The intent is to think historically and conceptually about the field of black literary studies by exploiting and refusing the distinctions between “theory” and “blackness.” Our work might include studying the following areas: archive, pessimism, feminism, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, phenomenology, affect\/new materialism, queer, disability, performance. In sum, this course is a chance to consider blackness as a point of departure for literary study, and perhaps the reverse—literary study as an engagement with thinking conceptually about blackness.","898":"Introduction to Marxist theory and literary theory, a powerful tool for cultural analysis.

This class will address the various methods and forms contemporary Black writers have used to discuss this ever-looming injustice that hangs over Black American life: how it impacts family structures and marriages and has altered various roles—including gender roles—within the Black community.","940":"Across thirteen collections published between 1969 and 2008, Lucille Clifton established herself as an essential American lyricist. This course is interested in Clifton’s poetics as philosophical thinking, in her investigation of what being human is (ontology), how the human is to be (ethics), what knowing is (epistemology). We will study Clifton’s engagement with the theological—especially of the Edenic—as a praxis for exploring trauma, language, time, and the beginning of the world. Most centrally, we will consider Clifton’s deployment of brevity, of vernacular or everyday language, as a philosophical and aesthetic enactment of ordinariness.","941":"South Africa has had a distinctive and tumultuous history: pre-colonial inter-ethnic dynamics; European settlement and rivalry played out on African soil; and, between 1948 and 1994, the policy of state racism called apartheid. In this seminar, we study fiction by South African writers who used the English language. The writers address moral and aesthetic questions occasioned by the challenge of trafficking in imaginative literature in a South Africa governed by repressive regimes of white supremacy. At the level of form, they do so in diverse ways. Issues that will engage us include debates around such literary-critical concepts as: protest, realism, modernism, and the “post-apartheid” in literature. Works by Brutus, Coetzee, Fugard, Gordimer, La Guma, Mda, Ndebele, Paton, Plaatje, and Wicomb. We will also discuss some poetry and the films Cry, the Beloved Country (1951; 1995), and Tsotsi (2005).","942":"Interested students must register for AMST 1920A .","943":"Studying literature presents far more problems than answers. In the first place, what counts as “literature,” and why does it need–or does it?--to be studied? Should we study a literary work as an entity unto itself, or does context play such a crucial role in the generation of meaning that we mustn’t ignore it? Or is it somehow necessary to treat a work of literature as both entirely independent and completely saturated with its cultural moment? We’ll explore these and many other problems inherent to the study of what is called literature. Authors may include Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and others.","944":"One of the more sensational developments in contemporary literature in the United States is the emergence of so-called “autofiction,” an abbreviation of the term “autobiographical fiction.” But what is distinctive about this literary form, if anything, and what is behind its current popularity? Does it, as one prominent theorist has proposed, denote “a new craving for reality in contemporary literature,” or is its significance on the contrary, in the words of another critic, that it “neatly and economically poses the question of the self as fiction”? This course will survey a range of “autofictional” practices in literature, art, and film, and consider several explanations for this wave of interest. Authors include Knausgaard, E. Hardwick, G. Murnane, Teju Cole, Sophie Calle, J. Panahi, Paul B. Preciado, A. Ernaux, F. Jameson, T. Moi, A. Kim.","945":"Interested students must register for MCM 1503E .","946":"Weekly seminar led by the Advisor of Honors in English.

We also address issues of professionalization as they relate to the first years of graduate work. Enrollment limited to 10. S\/NC.","951":"This class considers the political, psychic, sexual, and aesthetic implications of pain and pleasure in early modern literature. Primary texts include Shakespeare’s sonnets and comedies, Sidney’s Astrophel and Stella, and poetry by the Earl of Rochester, Robert Herrick, and Aphra Behn. Secondary texts include Deleuze, Freud, MacKinnon, Bersani, Jane Gallop, and Laura Kipnis.","952":"A flock of birds that hatewatch a dating show. A woman lost at sea in a rudderless boat. A wicker house, sixty miles wide, that spins in place and emits a cacophonous din. A rooster that has a very lousy dream. People who fall in love through their prison bars. People who beg to be excused from love. People who are on their fifth husband, whatever love's got to do with it. The music of the spheres. The insignificance of life. The horrible difficulty of discerning whether you're about to kiss someone on their face or on their posterior. And whether, in the end, we can ever know what a Chaucer even is (and does it matter?) No previous experience of medieval literature necessary.","953":"This seminar will investigate the history, theory, and practice of satire, with a focus on works by Jonathan Swift, the essential and paradigmatic satirist in the English language. Some attention will be given to a few of Swift’s eighteenth-century contemporaries, such as Alexander Pope, John Gay, Laurence Sterne, and Samuel Johnson. The last weeks of the course will be devoted to nineteenth- and twentieth-century texts by Jane Austen, Lord Byron, and Thomas Pynchon.","954":"Interested students must register for COLT 2650Y .","955":"The extraordinary volume and aesthetic variety of black literary art produced since the 1980s has elicited a wide range of theoretical and historical frameworks for interpreting this work. In assessing the interplay among these scholarly developments and African American literature, this seminar provides an overview of thought about contemporary black culture and gestures towards the intellectual work yet to be done. In so doing, the course also weighs the promise and limitations of interpretive frameworks such as post-segregation, post-nationalism, post-black, post-soul, and Afropessimism. Includes works by Paul Gilroy, Mark Anthony Neal, Christina Sharpe, Paul Beatty, Colson Whitehead, Danzy Senna, and Claudia Rankine.","956":"This course analyzes literary modernism as it intersects with theories of space both historical and formal. Topics include: colonialism and global spaces, Fordist production, gendered public\/private divides, as well as networks, underworlds, spatial form, and models of wandering. Readings include work by Lefebvre, Harvey, Latour, Frank, Larsen, Joyce, McKay, Woolf. Enrollment limited to 15 graduate students.","957":"We explore the structure of the plantation alongside the non- or anti-plantation spaces and practices that sprouted in its midst through fiction, scholarship, and film. We explore representations of enslaved and free black people’s sustenance gardening and husbandry, acts of marronage and indolence, millenarian cults, and the relationship between the paranormal or the supernatural and what is often called “nature.” Texts may include: novels by William Faulkner, Jamaica Kincaid, and Maryse Condé; films by Jordan Peele and Euzhan Palcy; scholarly texts by Colin Dayan and Saidiya Hartman; and narratives of events such as the Haitian Revolution and the rise and tragedies around of The Peoples Temple in the US and Jonestown and Liborismo in the Dominican Republic.","958":"In this introduction to postcolonial theory we will consider key Western sources (Hegel, Marx, Lacan, Levi Strauss, Emmanuel Levinas); anticolonial manifestos (Gandhi, Fanon, Césaire, Memmi); political and ethical practices (civil disobedience, armed struggle, friendship). In addition to canonical critics (Said, Bhabha, Spivak), the course will review new interests in the field (transnationalism, non-western imperialisms, the environmental turn). Offered as a collaborative humanities seminar in Spring 2025, Postcolonial Theory will host and think with a series of guest scholars.","959":"This graduate seminar pursues an interdisciplinary investigation of black feminist theories, methods, praxes, and politics. Using a black feminist lens, it investigates legacies of racial slavery and colonialism; the pathways and promises of African diaspora; citizenship, labor, and the law; theories of the flesh and changing definitions of kin; human ontology and the mutability of gender; black expressive practices and emancipatory politics. Enrollment limited to 15.","960":"From archives to monuments, photographs to films, sound recordings to selfies to Twitter feeds, modern life has reached a saturation point of object-driven memory. This course examines modes of capturing memory in the 20th and 21st centuries, and asks what replaces the medieval memory palace as an imaginary habitat for recollection. Enrollment limited to 15.","961":"Late Style has long been a topic of critical reflection, whether to describe the trajectory of an individual artist’s career or the ultimate achievement of a philosophical corpus. We also attach late and other markers of temporality, development or discontinuity, (im)maturity or belatedness, to broader intellectual movements and historical periods: Late Beethoven, Early Marx and Late Capital, or the New Criticism, the New(er) Historicism, post-modernism and the new eighteenth century. As this potentially interminable catalogue suggests, the late is not invariably attached to notions of mastery or wisdom, ripeness or completion, as the signifier of a desired end. In Late Style, Edward Said aligned lateness with &quot;intransigence and unresolved contradiction,&quot; indeed, with a kind of failure. This course examines the vicissitudes of the literary formalisms of the last century: have they reached a “late” moment, an intransigent but generative impasse?","962":"Writing and professionalization workshop intended for graduate students in literary studies. Topics covered include selection of journal; framing, structuring and composition of the article; the logistics of peer review; sharing and workshopping drafts; working with academic mentors and advisors.

Enrollment limited to 19 first year students. Instructor permission required.","971":"This is an engaged scholars course that offers an introduction to contemporary environmental issues. We explore the relationships between human societies and the non-human environment through a survey of topical cases, including: human population growth and consumption, global climate change, toxins, waste streams, water resources, environmental justice and ethics, and agro-food systems. This course also analyzes various solutions—social, political, technical, and economic—put forth by institutions and individuals to address questions of environmental sustainability. Each student must register for a 50-minute weekly engaged scholar lab in addition to lectures. Each lab will partner with a community organization to complete an engaged, environmental project. See class notes for reserved seating registration set up by semester level.","972":"Introduces students to environmental science and the challenges we face in studying human impacts on an ever-changing earth system. We will explore what is known, and not known, about how ecosystems respond to perturbations. This understanding is crucial, because natural systems provide vital services (water and air filtration, climate stabilization, food supply, erosion and flood control) that can not be easily or inexpensively replicated. Special emphasis will be placed on climate, food and water supply, population growth, and energy.","973":"Political ecology asks how power mediates human-environment relationships. How do we, as society, understand “the environment,” environmental problems, our role in them, and potential solutions? How have human-environment interactions reproduced inequity related to class, race, gender, and worldview; how does inequity, in turn, relate to environmental realities? Whose environmental “truth” counts, whose doesn’t, and why? Are better futures possible (and who defines “better futures”)? In this course, we will consider these questions and more. We will examine how knowledge production and socio-economic structures and processes relate to environmental change across economic, political, social, and ecological contexts. The first part of the course will introduce political ecology’s roots and major arguments. We will use this foundation to analyze real-world cases and consider the opportunities, or “openings,” for different environmental futures.","974":"In this course, we will examine ocean management for resilience and conservation: policy design, implementation, and effects on ecosystems and people. The use of tools such as marine protected areas and marine spatial planning has exploded in recent decades, and global interest in alternative energy, food security, and marine biodiversity conservation has heightened the use, and critique of these key tools in ocean conservation and resilience. Co-taught by an interdisciplinary team (a coastal ecologist and an oceans governance scholar), this course will explore questions such as: What management tools are available? What do they do (and not do) and how? How are they created and managed in particular contexts? Who gets to decide and why?","975":"Join Professor Seda Salap-Ayca and your fellow students on this journey of learning as the group delves into the topic of Cartography and Geovisualization. Why does it matter to engage with this topic? Maps are our powerful tools to tell stories, but what is the story behind them? What makes a map design effective? In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of cartography and map design. Students will critique and create appealing maps throughout the semester. There isn’t a prerequisite for the course, however, an introductory level of GIS will be helpful to understand the terminology and the concepts. If you haven’t taken any GIS course before, some basics will be covered during the training assignments. The majority of the hands-on exercises will be based on variety of software, therefore a basic level of computer skills is essential.","976":"Interested students must register for ANTH 1201 .","977":"Environmental, business, and social opportunities are often seen as being at odds. This course is a hands-on, interactive journey to explore bringing an impactful idea for an environmental product\/service\/solution into the world and designing a business plan to do so. You will identify an environmental area of opportunity, learn how to focus on the problem before the solution, identify the key stakeholders including your users\/customers, and build a business model. You will look at the triple bottom line, and learn new tools, best practices, and frameworks to breathe life into your solution and make it viable. Instructions for submitting a personal statement before enrolling will be available in the syllabus.","978":"We are connected to Land. Whether our connection is intimate and acknowledged or distant and unexplored, human (and other) lives are rooted in Land. In this course, we draw out matters of land, asking how and for whom land matters. Building on scholarship, journalism, public commentary, movements, podcasts, and videos, we explore land as a multifaceted and fundamental source of life, knowledge, community, wealth, power, theft, exclusion, sovereignty, justice, and healing. The course is grounded in US-based land histories and how colonial violence, patriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalism intersect to shape land access, control, and ownership. From this foundation, we explore on-the-ground efforts toward land justice, including decolonization, reparations, agrarian commons, and land trusts. Students will leave the course with frameworks for envisioning and helping to build equitable, just, and healthy Land futures based in stewardship, intention, and care.","979":"Whether air, water or land borne, pollution is a multivalent “wicked problem” that has profound implications for the climate, ecological and economic systems, and human health and well-being. Emphasizing engaged scholarship based in Providence, we will explore pollution’s historical origins, review current pollution measurements and reduction\/mitigation efforts, and discuss alternative approaches that better address pollution’s historical legacies and resulting social and environmental inequalities. Coursework will revolve around a Providence-based air monitoring project, augmented by readings, guest lectures, and discussion. Assessment will involve participation in discussion, 2-3 response papers and a final project linked to an engaged, field-study.","980":"Interested students must register for EEPS 1300 .","981":"Course develops students’ analytical abilities to apply fundamental concepts of environmental issues, building systems analysis, and architectural and engineering design.

Students will learn how to find answers to environmental questions, use recording equipment, conduct interviews, write scripts, and make a finished product. Students will produce several audio projects for the course including an episode for Possibly- a podcast produced through a partnership between IBES and The Public’s Radio. Students who want to enroll should write a one page (max) statement about how skills related to explaining environmental and health issues will help them in their educational trajectory. Statements can be emailed to Megan_Hall@Brown.edu.","983":"21st century businesses and investors face a broadening and deepening array of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks and opportunities. Climate change, water scarcity, community conflicts, resource depletion, supply chain breakdowns, worker well-being and economic inequality pose present material challenges that make sustainability an imperative for successful corporations and investors. We will examine current ESG strategy, trends, future scenarios, players, and frameworks and integrate that theory with practical investment performance analysis, metrics, and study of screens, asset classes, and diversification.","984":"Hunger amidst plenty is an enduringly wicked problem. Modern agriculture has become incredibly productive, fueling the global grain trade, the meatification of human diets, and the exponential expansion of food and non-food products. Still, the number of people who are hungry, food insecure, and\/or malnourished is stable or increasing in various parts of the world. As global population rises, calls to further increase and intensify agricultural production ring out across the globe. Through (agro-)ecological, feminist, and justice lenses, we will explore the political economy of food insecurity and agriculture, the political ecology of agricultural development, and critical humanist approaches to the past, present, and future of farming. We will connect with human geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, historians, Indigenous scholars, Black Studies scholars, feminists, and people working outside of academia.","985":"This is an engaged scholar course. Urban agriculture has a critical function in a small but increasing movement toward more localized and sustainable food systems. This course focuses on research and readings from multiple disciplines addressing urban agriculture and local food systems' role in shaping food policies, labor practices, sustainable agricultural practices, and human health (to name a few). More importantly, students will work with community partners to actively engage in a local food system project. Enrollment limited to 40.","986":"This course investigates current environmental impacts and risks related to urban infrastructure systems. Students analyze efforts to minimize negative environmental, health and economic impacts of the built environment. The course explores urban initiatives to increase sustainability and resiliency of infrastructure systems in anticipation of increased risks related to climate change.

But even as Western knowledge systems understand better the intrinsic interdependencies between humans and the non-human, policy gridlock persists. Indeed, scientific findings are regularly contested on political grounds. The purpose of this course is to learn how to apply diverse knowledges from Indigenous to Modern to map the relevant policy in problems at the intersection of human rights and environmental integrity, and to develop approaches to address them in ways that are creative, effective, responsible and just.","988":"This course offers a deep dive into ocean and coastal governance and policy. As residents of the Ocean State, how well do we understand how society interacts with ocean spaces and resources, from local to national and global scales? We will investigate how marine policy planning and implementation processes interact with particular political, social, and economic contexts through case study examples, local practitioner guest speakers, and in-class debates. Using a variety of marine policy sectors (e.g., fisheries, energy, and biodiversity management), we will critically evaluate management tools (e.g., market mechanisms, regulations, area-based management, and community-based management). We will unsettle “established” policy assumptions, asking: Who governs oceans? How does power relate to ocean policy creation and outcomes? What are the roles of science, knowledge, institutions, history, and context in how ocean governance plays out on the ground (or in the waves!)?","989":"As one of the world’s great civilizations, China has an unparalleled written record of how people have transformed their environments over 3000 years. This seminar will explore China’s environmental history from early times to the present by focusing on the words of people in China, which we will read in translation. China’s prosperity was historically based on millions of people producing food and other materials from the land, often replacing natural ecosystems with farms, tree plantations and other human ecosystems. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 this has been combined with intensive government development projects and highly polluting industrialization. We will read a wide variety of translated sources to understand this history, including landscape poetry, medical manuals, travel narratives, geographies, laws, Buddhist texts, recipe books, and even science fiction.","990":"How does the American public think about and talk about climate change, and how are these discussions shaped by the interventions of powerful interest groups and political elites? In this course, we will consider how individuals’ understandings of climate change are deeply shaped by relations of power, from corporate strategies to delay meaningful action on climate change, to the norms and operations of media institutions, to dominant environmentalist discourses that fail to engage larger socioeconomic structures. While we will primarily discuss how public understanding has historically been constrained by the operation of power, we consider throughout possibilities for crafting climate narratives that resist these limitations to pursue transformative change. This course will focus primarily on climate politics in the United States, but we will also consider other national contexts and impacts on communities across the globe.","991":"What goes into the things we use everyday? Who makes commodities and under what conditions? What happens to stuff after we throw it away? Are we stuck with mass consumption? Are there workable alternatives? These are the kinds of questions we will unpack. Reading from commodity and discard studies, and political economy and ecology, we will situate economic growth in social and environmental context. We will look at production, extraction, circulation, disposal, and afterlives of commodities, with particular attention to invisibilized labor and environmental externalities. And we will explore sustainability proposals, including circularity, degrowth, and repair. In addition to an individual paper, you will apply analytical tools in a semester-long research project to examine a commodity of your choosing. With peers, you will produce a report, narrative website, video, or web-series to narrate the life and afterlife of your thing.","992":"Narratives are key to how we understand our world—making nonfiction storytelling a critical part of comprehending and acting in a time of environmental crises. Through regular writing practice and discussions of readings and other media—including podcasts and film—this class will examine models for how nonfiction narratives can foster a better understanding of past and present environmental change, imagine an environmentally just future, explain technical information for a broad audience, and support an informed, politically active citizenry. Visits from authors and creators will supplement class discussion, as assignments build toward each student completing an environmentally-focused creative narrative project.","993":"From coal power to solar power, energy drives economies and increases quality of life world-wide. However, this same energy use can, and often does, lead to severe environmental destruction\/pollution and global warming. This course serves as an introduction to energy policy in the United States and also explores global attempts to solve energy problems. This course examines different types of energy sources and uses, different ideological paths driving energy policy, the environmental impacts of energy use, current global and domestic attempts to solve energy problems, and the role of renewable and alternative forms of energy in future energy policy.","994":"This senior seminar investigates chemical and other forms of industrially produced waste and its impacts on environment and society. We will take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on scholarship from anthropology, geography, history, sociology, science studies, and discard studies. We will follow chemicals around the world, from their inception in Western laboratories to their disposal in landfills and waste pits of the global South. Along the way, we will consider how corporations engineer chemicals’ manufacture, governments regulate their use, sciences measure their human and ecological effects, and communities contend with the lived realities of chemical exposure and toxic suffering.","995":"We will examine the historical formation, contemporary reality and popular representation of the U.S.-Mexico border from a bilingual (English-Spanish), multicultural (U.S., Mexican, and Latino), and transnational perspective within the framework of globalization. We will explore the construction of border communities, lives and identities on both sides of the international divide, and pay particular attention to the movement of peoples in both directions. We will read materials, watch films, and conduct class discussions in English and Spanish. Comfort and reasonable proficiency in Spanish is required, but native command is not necessary. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.","996":"This in-person, discussion-based seminar serves as an introduction to contemporary US Latinx Art. How do we understand the category “Latinx Art” and its history? How have the expressive iterations of different communities reflected on community dynamics and politics? How do contemporary curatorial projects provide platforms to envision Latinx futures? Departing from the cultural expressions linked to US Latinx civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s, this class will dwell on diverse formal and thematic approaches and foci in contemporary US Latinx Art to reflect more broadly on the ideological impact of expressive culture. We will do so by studying the expressive culture of artists in the United States of Latin American descent as well as the interdisciplinary critical scholarship of art history and visual culture scholars. Attendance to relevant local exhibitions and artist talks will be encouraged.","997":"This course provides an introduction to the histories of people of Asian descent in the United States from the late 18th century to the present. We will focus on the experiences of people with ancestries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central Asia, considering commonalities and differences by nationality, class, gender, religion, place, and other factors. Topics include orientalism in U.S. culture, immigration and exclusion, Asian American civil rights struggles, and the “model minority.” We eschew any claim that an “authentic” or “typical” Asian American experience exists, instead working from the idea that Asian Americans and their lives are multifaceted, complex, and dynamic. Course materials will include primary and secondary sources and incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship and approaches while being anchored in history.","998":"Considers the U.S. as a society whose unifying identity is rooted in ethnic and racial diversity. Explores the historical and contemporary experiences of racial and ethnic groups in this country and analyzes different forms of representation of those experiences, as well as representations of the racial and ethnic stratification in the U.S. imagination.","999":"In the past, formalized schooling in Indigenous communities was a tool of colonization and cultural genocide, forcing Native peoples to assimilate to western norms, values, and knowledge. However, contemporary Indigenous communities have managed to reclaim and reshape education for Native youth, utilizing innovative methods and technologies, as well as drawing upon generations of traditional and indigenous knowledges to create environments that promote academic achievement alongside culture. In this course we will focus on the ways Native communities are asserting their educational sovereignty, through culturally-relevant\/responsive curriculums, language immersion schools, indigenous charter schools, traditional ecological and scientific knowledges, and more.","1000":"This course provides an introduction to major issues and formative historical moments within the field of Asian American Studies. Course readings are highly interdisciplinary drawing from scholarship in history, literature, sociology and political science. This course spans multiple historical moments beginning in the mid-1800s and continuing through the present. Topics covered include Asian immigrant and refugee experiences, the movement for Asian American Studies, the construction of an Asian American pan-ethnic identity, community political mobilization and efforts to combat Islamaphobia and anti-Asian violence.","1001":"This course will introduce students to a broad array of Latinx literature. While there is a long tradition of Latinx literature in the United States, we will focus primarily on a period from 1985 to the present. Aimed to familiarize students with debates in the field, the readings will also include critical essays. Enrollment limited to 15.","1002":"This class examines and introduces the politics, cultures, histories, representations, and studies of the Native peoples of North America, with a primary focus on the United States, and helps students to develop critical thinking, reading, and writing skills regarding Native American and Indigenous Studies. Although broad in cultural and geographic scope, the course does not attempt to summarize the diverse cultures of the hundreds of Native American tribes across the continent or Indigenous peoples globally. Instead, it focuses on several key issues in the lives of, and scholarship about, American Indian\/Native American\/First Nations\/Indigenous peoples in the US (and beyond).","1003":"What is the impact of legal status on the potential for undocumented individuals' participation in a social movement? Relatedly, how is the heterogeneity of movement participants represented in campaigns and political protest? In this course we will examine the undocumented immigrant movement in the United States today through readings, films and guest lectures from local immigrant rights activists. As part of the course students will be partnered with local community based organizations where they will complete a semester-long internship.","1004":"This undergraduate seminar explores U.S. urban and suburban histories during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, through the concerns of race and ethnicity. We seek to understand how dilemmas over and struggles for belonging and equality in the United States have played out in and over urban and suburban spaces. We will pay particular attention to the histories of segregation, housing discrimination, urban unrest, suburban integration, the rise of “ethnoburbs,” and gentrification. Readings represent foundational texts and new directions in scholarship and provide in-depth examinations of particular urban and suburban communities. Topics include the simultaneous erasure and appropriation of Indigenous peoples in the development of Pacific Northwest cities; the Asian American “model minority” and integration of all-white suburbs; minority grassroots activism and resistance against redevelopment; racism and neoliberal urban governance in the 21st century. RPP","1005":"Writing Latinx Lives examines the boom over the last couple decades in Latinx memoirs. The course is interested in the rigorous analysis of life writing. What gets written? Who is writing it? What social, political, cultural trends are the writers in dialogue with? And so forth. We will read these memoirs along with critical analyses of the genre.

Enrollment limited to 15.","1012":"Folktales are fantastical stories, but they are also connected to social realities in profound and surprising ways. In this course we will explore what folktales and their adaptations in literature and film have to tell us about the cultures in which they are (re)told. Focusing on stories from France, the Maghreb, West Africa, the Caribbean, and North America, we will consider how storytelling and folktales both reaffirm and critique social structures and how, in former colonies of France, adaptations respond to (post)colonial realities. Using a comparative approach, we will examine how similar folkloric plots are treated across different contexts, but also how and why certain tales are privileged in each culture. Along with critical readings and films, we will study adaptations by d’Aulnoy, Perrault, Ben Jelloun, Mammeri, Senghor, Dadié, Diop, and Chamoiseau, among others. Taught in French.","1013":"The Romance family is one of the most widely-spoken and politically important language families. The aim of this course is to introduce students to the history and linguistic characteristics of the Romance family. Our purpose is to learn the factors that led to the development of modern standard Romance languages, and provide an understanding of Romance structures and their linguistic relationships. The course covers language families; genetic relationships (family trees); typological comparison; internal versus external history; language contact and borrowing; Romance Pidgins and Creoles; Standard language versus dialect; social variation; concepts of Phonetics and Phonology; Morphology; Syntax; Semantics; Lexicon.","1014":"In-depth study of Molière's theater and its cultural contexts.

For each author we will read one play and one novel, to consider how form inflects writerly projects, and conversely to consider, through the lens of each writer's project, the specific potentialities and limits of form. Secondary writings will be drawn from narratology, theater theory, and critical theory\/philosophy. Taught in French","1016":"Poetry begins with (more) white space on the page. The modernist remaking of poetry - beginning somewhere in the second half of the 19th century and lasting more or less through the first half of the 20th – brought about an exponential increase in the volume of that space, and in various other extensions of it (e.g. into design and drawing, into the unconscious). The course will briefly examine the origins of those transformations in the 19th century and follow through their ramifications in poets such as Apollinaire, the Surrealists, Cocteau, Bataille and Ponge.

From political theory to philosophy and history, Africa is at the heart of a burgeoning body of theory that this course sets out to examine. The singularity of this course resides in the fact that it will maintain, a continental perspective that includes the Maghreb or North Africa within Africa throughout the semester. Emphasis will be placed on French-speaking sources from West and North Africa, which are often neglected in English-speaking contexts. The need for such a perspective is represented by Frantz Fanon’s Pan-Africanism, which calls for the abolition of the Saharan frontier between &quot;North&quot; and &quot;Black&quot; Africa. Marginalized or simply unknown authors will be studied, including: Abdelkebir Khatibi, Paulin Hountondji, Fabien Eboussi Boulaga, Malek Bennabi, Youssef Seddik, Hichem Djaït, Mohammed Talbi, Lepold Sedar Senghor, among others.","1020":"Barthes and Derrida developed their reputations as thinkers along very different tracks: Barthes from a literary and rhetorical perspective, Derrida within the philosophical tradition. Both posed persistently and explicitly the question of literature. For Barthes, this involved putting literary texts to the test of new forms of analysis based on structuralist and semiological research, while arguing for a discipline that exposed “the place and energy of the [reading] subject.” Derrida often used literature to challenge traditional philosophy, and play a double-agent role within his sense of “writing,” while also analyzing its resources on their own terms, revealing criticism’s lack of both rigor and adventure, and relating literary questions to high stakes political and ethical questions. We will study a representative series of texts by Barthes and Derrida that continue to provide important models for a critical approach to literary writing.","1021":"Interested students must register for HMAN 2401Y .","1022":"For graduate students who have completed their course work and are preparing for a preliminary examination.","1023":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","1024":"Explores the interdisciplinary fields of Gender and Sexuality Studies, considering the relation between formations of gender and those of sexuality across a range of historical and disciplinary contexts. Considers how both sexuality and gender are shaped in relation to race and ethnicity, economic inequality, and the postcolonial legacy.","1025":"This course takes an intimate look at Sapphic culture from the late 19th century to present. Since its most recent renaissance in the mid-2010s, the Sapphic has emerged as an elusive disruptor; an umbrella term that welcomes lesbians, wlw, nonbinary and trans femmes and mascs. This seminar explores how the Sapphic functions not just as an identity category but a methodology (a way of reading, writing, looking, listening) and an aesthetic in art, design, fashion, and food. What are the ways in which the Sapphic works with\/against lesbian and queer political identities? How does contemporary use of the Sapphic diverge from its past iterations in literature, literary criticism, and visual culture? How might we understand temporality in Sapphic expression (slow-burn, yearning)? Competency in Sapphic arts requires participation in seminar discussions, completion of 3 short essays, and a final essay\/creative project.","1026":"If the will to knowledge is a will to power, what of the will to not know? How is ignorance a resource—a form of self-protection, a source of cognitive dissonance, and a tool of political control? How is ignorance produced? This course considers epistemology from the perspective of what we don’t know, what we refuse to know, and what we can’t know. Drawing from philosophical, decolonial, theological, psychoanalytic, sociological, feminist, queer, and trans discourses, this interdisciplinary course explores such concepts as Glissant’s “right to opacity,” Sedgwick’s ignorances and nonce taxonomies, and Žižek's theory of ideology as fetishistic disavowal. Texts will include Beauchamp’s Going Stealth, Derrida’s “How to Avoid Speaking: Denials,” Freud’s “Fetishism,” Glazer’s Zone of Interest, C. Mills’s “White Ignorance,” Moten’s “Blackness and Nothingness,” Ozeki’s My Year of Meats, Rivière’s “Woman as Masquerade,” and Smithson’s “Social Theories of Ignorance.”","1027":"A research seminar focusing on the research and writing of the participants. Required of senior concentrators; open to other advanced students by permission.","1028":"Gender and Sexuality Studies is by its very nature interdisciplinary. Can we speak of any single methodology that ties GNSS together? How might scholars working on gender\/sexuality acknowledge disciplinary boundaries and use disciplinary training effectively? We will start with the premise that studies in gender and sexuality are tied together by questioning foundational assumptions within a given field of knowledge and taking account of our own subject positions vis-à-vis our objects of study. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and\/or queer focus, we will investigate how gender and sexuality are constructed in various contexts, what kind of work they do, and how standards of evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines. Particular attention will be given to the role of critique, affect, and materialisms, including the materiality of language, in gender and sexuality studies.","1029":"This seminar experiments with form to think about writing and poetics as modes of embodied experience. What are the ways to trace the presences and absences of the colonial Anthropocene? How do we write, visualize, engage with the disappeared and extinct, but also the processes of metamorphosis, metabolics, desire, and queer and trans ecologies that are entangled with anthropogenic crisis? How do the elements of environmental writing underscore the means by which to enliven forms of care, repair, and belonging towards a post-extractive world? We attend to Indigenous, Africana, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Global South perspectives, modes of narration, visuality and experimentation asking throughout how gender and sexuality shift what we know and how we write about it.

In 1775, after its discontinuation, Claudius started collecting his own contributions to the newspaper and to publish them under the title Sämtliche Werke des Wandsbecker Boten. Similarly, yet differently, another project––a calendar addressed to the peasant population of Baden––materialized 40 years later: Der Rheinländische Hausfreund, written by Johann Peter Hebel, who edited the calendar between 1808 and 1815. Due to its huge success, the best stories from the first four issues were published as a book in 1811: Schatzkästlein des rheinischen Hausfreunds. This extraction of their contributions for both newspaper and calendar underlines the subversive character of Claudius’ and Hebel’s projects. Both their writings went beyond the day: into a sphere where chronological and calendaric time implode.––Taught in German.","1054":"In 1803 the German jurist and historian Carl Friedrich von Savigny publishes a civil treatise Das Recht des Besitzes, dealing with the question of how to describe and justify private property as possession. Almost 50 years later, Jacob Grimm delivers a lecture under a similar yet slightly––and decisively––different title: Das Wort des Besitzes, dealing not only with the history and semantics of the word Besitz but with the word itself. His lecture transforms a juridical question into a linguistic one: how is it possible (and is it possible at all) to possess a word? In other words: to turn a language into one’s own in order to possess it? The seminar will discuss aspects of this question in philosophical, linguistic, and literary texts by (among others) Kant, Babeuf, Proudhon, Hölderlin, Marx, Droste-Hülshoff, and Franz Kafka.––Taught in German.","1055":"Writing--vocation or duty, gift or curse, poison or antidote? This course provides an introduction to Kafka's stories, novels, journal entries, and letters, with a focus on his complicated, tortured relationship to the idea and practice of writing.

This is a writing-intensive course, and the frequent short assignments will involve drafts, revisions, and individual consultations, with the aim of getting you to think critically about your own relationship to writing about literature. In English. Enrollment limited to 40. First year students require instructor permission.","1056":"This course features three authors who have each in their own way made significant contributions to critical literature and thinking. We will start with Brecht’s revolutionary approach to the theory and practice of theater and with selections from his short prose and explore some of his seminal texts on these subjects. Peter Weiss’s and Alexander Kluge’s work is less well known in the English-speaking world, but they also performed groundbreaking work in the areas of historical and documentary literature and in experimental film and literature. In German","1057":"Since the Enlightenment, childhood has been at the center of the Western imagination. In German-language literature, political models of society, psychological theories on the dynamics of thinking and feeling, and critical discussions of history are often negotiated on the basis of an outline of what childhood is. This is because studying how humans develop promises to provide insight into what it means to be human and permits one to construct images of how humans should live. This line of thought breaks from a centuries-old convention of equating children with animals due to their lack of articulate speech and regretting this phase. In this course, we will read key texts of German-language literature from the Enlightenment to the present day that expound childhood as a special, formative epoch of individual life that, at the same time, grants insight into social dynamics.","1058":"In Western cultures, the visual sense has traditionally received preferential treatment, having been associated most closely with knowledge and understanding, as demonstrated by the words ‘evidence’ and ‘theory.’ Especially at academic institutions, we want both ‘overview’ and ‘insight,’ to ‘look at’ something ‘very closely,’ and examine it through various ‘lenses’ (theoretical frameworks). On the other hand, there is also the obverse, where the optical stands for superficiality, mere appearance, and even deception and confusion. In other words, when we take a closer look at ‘seeing,’ things appear more complicated than they did at first glance. Texts and movies by Plato, Sophocles, Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Goethe, Kleist, Oscar Wilde, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Stéphane Mallarmé, Tuvia Ruebner, Michel Foucault, Paul de Man, Wim Wenders, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Toni Morrison. Taught in English, no prerequisites.","1059":"What is called poem, poet and poetry, in English today, is called differently, in different languages at different times. The semantics of German Dichter, Gedicht and Dichtung differ considerably from their Greek equivalents – poieîn, poíema, poietés –. A third case, indicaged by the names trobador, trouvère and troubadour, opens yet another field: of invention, discovery, and unexpected turns. This seminar will explore all three manifestations of poietic, dichterische or inventive explanations with what is called language in both their incompatibilities and similarities. Texts to be read and discussed will include Emily Dickinson, Ezra Pound and George Oppen; Martin Heidegger, Paul Celan, Emil Staiger, Eduard Mörike; Sappho, Plato, Aristotle, Jesper Svenbro; Cicero, Quintilian, Jacques Roubaud, Jean de La Fontaine, Guillaume IX d’Aquitaine, Daniel Arnaut, and Jaufre Rudel.","1060":"What is a moment? What will a moment have meant? Is a moment completely over as long as I can still conjure it in memory? The more one thinks about the moment, the more inscrutable it appears. Seemingly the most basic of experiences, the moment remains nevertheless shrouded in darkness, as already Plato, in the late dialogue Parmenides, worried. Our seminar will examine the “darkness of the lived moment,” as Ernst Bloch, the great political philosopher of hope, named it. What appears in the immediacy of our experience, is actually far removed from our understanding, but it does open onto an unforeclosed futurity. We will contemplate this darkness of the lived moment in a constellation of works drawn from literature and the arts; and in relation to theoretical texts by such thinkers as Bloch, Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, and Blanchot.","1061":"The memory of National Socialism has been as mainstay of post-1990 German politics and culture. However, at least with the end of the Cold War, national German memory culture has also been challenged by non-national perspectives, especially by the necessity to commemorate the entanglement of National Socialism with Communist totalitarianisms and to situate German memory culture within a Central and Eastern European context. To engage with this tension, we will read theoretical texts that continue to inform current memory debates (Arendt, Mitscherlich), recent social sciences approaches to transgenerational transmissions of psycho-social sequelae of perpetration and complicity (Welzer &amp; al., Mihai, Gobodo-Madikizela), and literary texts that have brought transgenerational transmissions into the focus of public attention (Bernhard, Sebald), in order then to focus on contemporary German-language texts that negotiate the difficulties of commemorating totalitarianisms.","1062":"The resonances between the oeuvres of Martin Heidegger and Jacques Lacan far exceed such passages as the one from “The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious, or Reason Since Freud” where Lacan explicitly alludes to his French translation of Heidegger’s essay “Logos (Heraclitus, Fragment 50).” In this seminar, participants will probe the various ways in which Heidegger’s meditations on the historical essence of truth and the metaphysical framework of modern science intersect with Lacan’s analytic formulations concerning the fictional structure of truth and the subject of science. Special attention will be given to their respective conjugations of being, logic, and language, as well as the literary writings that inflect their approaches to placing truth, subjectivity, and science in question.","1063":"For graduate students who have met the tuition requirement and are paying the Registration Fee to continue active enrollment while preparing for a preliminary examination.","1064":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","1065":"This is the first part of a two-semester Ancient Greek course.

Help us unearth these writers from the dusty shelves of libraries and rescue them from invisibility.","1104":"On a continent where pretexts for the privation of liberty range from criminal activity to political beliefs to cross-border migration, creative writing - as Chilean-American writer and human rights activist Ariel Dorfman once commented - has a powerful relationship to hope and survival. In this course, we will read poetry, short fiction and testimonial writing from spaces of detention across Latin America and the U.S., asking how subjects in detention represent themselves, their aspirations to freedom, their physical and social environment, and the languages of defense and protection that ostensibly justify their detention. Primary texts by contemporary writers in Cuba, Mexico, Argentina, the U.S. and at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base; readings and class discussion in Spanish.","1105":"What does it mean to be human? Does the human experience have limits? What happens when we stop being at center stage and something else, animals, plants, technology, the climate, starts occupying our place? Historically, answers to these questions have come from U.S., European and Asian culture, their film industry, literature, speculative artifacts, and academia. In this class, however, we will search to answer these questions from the perspective of Latin American, a standpoint marked by cultural multiplicity, sociopolitical complexity, uneven development, and radical imagination. Starting with Latin American historians who have written on who is and who gets to be human in the region, we will explore various aspects of the Latin American human and posthuman condition through analyzing non-textual media, literature, cultural essays, and the historical framework that produced them. We will concentrate on materials from Argentina, Bolivia,","1106":"“To survive”, wrote Mexican writer-turned-artist Ulises Carrión in 1979, “books need to change their form”.

Its logic is not encoded on human DNA, and its practices are not the inevitable outcome of supply and demand. So how did capitalism become the dominant economic system of the modern world? History can provide an answer by exploring the interaction of culture and politics, technology and enterprise, and opportunity and exploitation from the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade to the 2008 Financial Crisis. HIST 0150 courses introduce students to methods of historical analysis, interpretation, and argument. This class presumes no economics background, nor previous history courses.","1112":"A long history lies behind the millions of men and women locked up today as prisoners, captives and hostages.

The second part of the class investigates the consequences and opportunities of decolonization, including questions of political legitimacy, state-building, structural adjustment programs and international aid, human rights, and civil conflicts.","1117":"The Middle East is the only region of land to bridge three continents and is—arguably—the most controversial to discuss in the US today. Assuming no prior knowledge of a region that persistently captures headlines, this course provides a robust introduction to modern Middle East history, with two parts: (1) a brief history of the early-modern Ottoman Empire, from the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 to imperial collapse in WWI; and (2) the dramatic remaking of Southern Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and North Africa into a new “Mideast\/MENA” region from Ottoman partition to present times. Throughout, we explore the pivotal role of this region—and narratives about its past—from a variety of “3D” perspectives: water, soil, fossil fuels; governance and trade; religion\/spirituality, law, and family life; art, literature, music, and sports; and nationalism, militarism, humanitarianism, and environmentalism.","1118":"This course, covering the period roughly from 1820-1865 and focusing mostly on 1860-1865, examines the origins of the Civil War, the war itself, and preliminary efforts at reconstruction during wartime. The class meetings and readings will focus on the transformation wrought by the war, investigating in particular certain issues relevant to current affairs: 1) enslavement, emancipation, and struggles for equality; 2) sectionalism, secession, and insurrection; 3) the role of law in the prosecution and resolution of war; and 4) the role of the Civil War in American popular culture and politics. There are no prerequisites--the course is accessible to students at all levels--but some knowledge of U.S. history might be useful.","1119":"Religion has played an undeniable role in the contemporary American cultural landscape. This course lends some perspective on the present by investigating the various and, at times, surprising role religion has played in history in the shaping of American culture from 1865 to the present.","1120":"Examines Reconstruction (conventionally, 1863-1877, and often called the first civil rights revolution in the United States), and the political violence used to combat it.

This course will conclude with a discussion of attempts by the international community to prevent and punish genocide along with various ways in which genocide has been commemorated or denied.","1122":"From tango to plastic surgery, Donald Duck to reggaeton, this course places popular culture at the center of modern Latin American and Caribbean history. How, we will ask, did popular culture reflect and shape struggles over national belonging? How did foreign cultural products come to bear on international relations and transnational flows? In what contexts has culture served as a vehicle of resistance to dominant ideologies and systems of power? Far from a mere &quot;diversion,&quot; popular culture instead offers a compelling lens onto the relationship between state and society in Latin America and beyond.","1123":"This U.S. history seminar introduces students to the Brown University Library’s Special Collections by examining its archival holdings on 20th century activism. We will focus on the archives of imprisoned activist Mumia Abu-Jamal, student protest at Brown, and the Hall-Hoag Collection of US right- and left-wing political groups.","1124":"In the middle of the eighteenth century, the Americas belonged to a handful of European monarchies; within a few decades, most of the Americas was composed of independent republics, some of the European monarchs were either deposed or quaking on their thrones. Usually considered separately, revolutions in British North America, France, Saint-Domingue (Haiti) and Spanish America had diverse local circumstances yet composed a single cycle of intellectual ferment, imperial reform, accelerating violence and, forging of new political communities. We will examine revolutions that helped create the world we live in. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.

Students will also research and write their own historical-biographical essays.","1126":"Emerson and Dylan are cultural icons. Emerson has been called “Mr. America” and Dylan has just won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Both had boundless energy for public performance and self-representation; both actively supported turning points in the civil rights struggle; both raged against American military aggression; both were at the epicenter of a wide circle of intellectuals, while denying their own centrality. What is the celebrity intellectual’s responsibility to society while remaining true to oneself? Poems, essays, autobiographies, songs, and movies provide insight into these eternally fascinating geniuses and their times.","1127":"This course places two stories side-by-side: changing experiences and conceptions of disability in the United States and changing experiences and conceptions of the nonhuman environment. Reading scholarship in environmental and disability history and relying on a diverse array of primary sources, this course traces relationships between bodies, minds, and land in the U.S. over the past 200 years. Through histories of slavery, animal labor, wilderness preservation, atomic radiation, disability and environmental activism, and COVID-19, we will ask how human and nonhuman bodies were made and unmade in processes of environmental change indoors and out, how the political meanings of disability, incapacity, and productivity were constructed over time, and what a just future for disabled life and the nonhuman world might entail. This course requires no prerequisites and introduces key topics and approaches in both U.S. environmental history and disability history\/studies.","1128":"Interested students must register for JUDS 0050M .","1129":"Interested students must register for COLT 0510K .","1130":"Interested students must register for AFRI 0090 .","1131":"Interested students must register for EDUC 0610 .","1132":"Interested students must register for EAST 0141 .","1133":"This course considers the most extreme form of settler colonial dispossession -- South African apartheid. We examine the ideological and capitalist foundations of economic, political, social, and territorial segregation. We also explore the range of visions for how to do away with apartheid and what should come after it. The dramatic story of struggle ended with what some considered a near-miraculous resolution in 1994. Our consideration of the decades since then reveals the compromises of that resolution and the enduring burden of South Africa's colonial past.","1134":"This lecture-discussion course traces the rich history of Chinese political thinking from the beginnings of written history—when different visions of good governance competed for the attention of the rulers of the day—through to the present. We begin with the study of ancient political ideas, for it is during the earliest periods of Chinese history that the greatest variety of government modes are proposed. Political philosophy is the focus, but we also examine the institutions that were developed to translate ideals into action and to the tensions that arose as a consequence of efforts to reconcile different political philosophies in practice during the imperial period. The last section of the course is devoted to the radical changes in thinking and government institutions that take place over the course of the late nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries.","1135":"What does it mean to live on the borders of a rising world power? This course explores the commonalities and differences of the vast areas where China meets Central, South, Northeast, and Southeast Asia.

Students will also learn how ideas about gender, race, and tradition were understood and made use of in Imperial Japan. Open to all students.","1137":"Uses film, oral histories, historical fiction, and more traditional forms of historical interpretation to explore the events, ideas, and legacies of Japan's Pacific War. The armed conflict began in 1937 with the Japanese invasion of China and ended in 1945 with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some attention is paid to military developments, but the principle concerns fall into the areas of mutual images, mobilization, and memory.","1138":"The collapse of the Roman Empire was the crucible in which the cultures of the medieval West, Byzantium, and Islam were forged. This class examines the tensions and transformations within Mediterranean society between 250 and 1100 CE and how these tribulations gave birth to new identities, boundaries, economies, and religious beliefs. We will explore too the points of contact between the emerging Latin, Byzantine, and Islamic worlds and how people living in the late ancient and early medieval Mediterranean sought to devise solutions to the challenges that confronted them as their worlds collapsed, expanded, and changed. Class meetings will interweave narrative and thematic lectures with student analysis of primary sources in translation. Topics include early Christianity, the body, gender, barbarian invasions and the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the rise of Islam, Charlemagne, and the Vikings. P","1139":"For two centuries, Viking marauders struck terror into hearts of European Christians. Feared as raiders, Norsemen were also traders and explorers who maintained a network of connections stretching from North America to Baghdad and who developed a complex civilization that was deeply concerned with power and its abuses, the role of law in society, and the corrosive power of violence. This class examines the tensions and transformations within Norse society between AD 750 and 1100 and how people living in the Viking world sought to devise solutions to the challenges that confronted them as their world expanded and changed. P","1140":"Why do we think that one human being can judge another? How did this activity, enshrined in legal and political systems, profoundly shape society? This course examines the changing face of justice, from the medieval ordeal to judicial torture; the expansion of inquisitorial and state law courts; and the critical role the judicial system played in shaping Italian society. Using Italy as a focus, the course explores how law courts defined social, political, scientific, and religious truth in the early modern period. P","1141":"Examines politics, religion, and society from the Protestant Reformation to the Puritan Revolution-a period of rapid and dramatic change when the world, for most English people, was turned upside down. Considers the experiences and concerns of ordinary men and women, as well as the elite. Takes in Scotland, Ireland, and the great migration to New England. P","1142":"A survey of British history from the restoration of monarchy to the Wilkes affair and the loss of the American colonies. In addition to political developments such as the Glorious Revolution and the rise of party, examines political ideology (including the great political theorist, John Locke) and various themes in social history (such as crime, popular protest, the sexual revolution, and the experiences of women). P","1143":"This course charts the long history and continuing legacies of the British Empire, an entity that has transformed every single continent over the last four centuries and is widely associated with the makings of the modern world. We examine how and why a powerful and expansive British Empire emerged and sustained itself. Equally, we zoom in on the regular contestation and even outright rebellion that this transcontinental polity inspired. This course is an opportunity to think connectively and comparatively about historical experiences in America, India, the Caribbean, and Africa among multiple other British imperial spaces. We will track the making and unmaking of the British Empire by studying the evolution of global trade, labor regimes including slavery, the consumption of commodities such as sugar, as well as new ideas about governance, race, and identity.","1144":"Cuba, once the jewel in the Spanish imperial crown, has been home to some of the world's most radical revolutions and violent retrenchments. For two centuries, its influence has spread well beyond its borders, igniting the passion of nationalists and internationalists as well as the wrath of imperial aggression. This course traces the history of Cuba from its colonial origins through the present, foregrounding the revolutionary imaginary that has sustained popular action-from anti-slavery rebellions through the Cuban Revolution and its discontents-in addition to the historical processes that have forged one of the world's most vibrant socio-cultural traditions.","1145":"Before the Spanish invaded in the 1530s, western South America was the scene of the largest state the New World had ever known, Tawantinsuyu, the Inca empire. During almost 300 years of colonial rule, the Andean provinces were shared by the &quot;Republic of Spaniards&quot; and the &quot;Republic of Indians&quot; - two separate societies, one dominating and exploiting the other. Today the region remains in many ways colonial, as Quechua- and Aymara-speaking villagers face a Spanish-speaking state, as well as an ever-more-integrated world market, the pressures of neoliberal reform from international banks, and the melting of the Andean glaciers.","1146":"This course is centered around the relationship between history and storytelling. It takes as a starting point that history is itself political, and asks that we always consider both how and why we tell stories about the past. Together, we will critically examine a broad range of films and texts that engage with the Latin American past, and explore what they have to say about how gender and sexuality, imperialism, slavery, the church, revolution and repression shaped the region. How do films represent the past, and how do we approach “historical film”? How have narrative and documentary films been used as in various social and political struggles? Each week, we will examine documentary, narrative, or experimental films in relation to other modes of historical storytelling, from academic historiography to graphic novels, first person testimonios, memoirs, oral histories, and journalism.","1147":"The Ottoman Empire (1299—1923) was the longest-lived and most powerful Islamicate dynasty in history. From nomadic Turkic warriors in Asia to multiethnic empire straddling three continents, the Ottomans became the premier power in the Mediterranean world and the last to single-handedly govern most of today’s Middle East\/MENA. Yet, Ottoman formation and evolution—fusing Roman, Mongol, and Persianate imperial heritages, as well as Muslim, Christian, and Jewish faith communities—remain little understood. This course explores West Asia, Southern Europe, and North Africa through the prism of Ottoman history from medieval beginnings to modern legacies, including those surviving Ottoman partition after WWI. We shall engage difficult questions surrounding law and empire, religion and secularism, nationalism and state-building, and the legacies of Ottoman rule in and outside today’s Turkey—from Bosnia to Baghdad, Ukraine to Yemen, and “where East meets West”: Constantinople\/Istanbul.","1148":"Palestinians are largely absent in histories of Palestine\/Israel. This course introduces new scholarship that draws on local sources, oral history, ethnographic research to help us explore three fundamental questions: Who are the Palestinians? What do they want? And why has the Palestinian question become a central issue in global debates about the making of the modern world and its potential futures? The course covers the modern period (1750 to the present) and engages larger themes of capitalist transformation, imperialism, settler-colonialism, nationalism, and indigeneity.","1149":"This course explores the politics and culture of the United States between the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 and the financial crisis of the late 1830s. The establishment of the federal government still left crucial questions unresolved: the characteristics of national identity, the boundaries of citizenship, the legitimacy of slavery, and the tense relationship between capitalism, colonialism, and democracy. Relying on primary sources and secondary scholarship, the course will revisit familiar debates over warfare, sovereignty, and public policy, while also introducing students to a wide range of critical voices seeking to fulfill the idealistic possibilities of the American Revolution.","1150":"In this class, we’ll consider some of the forms of empire-building by various groups of indigenous and colonizing peoples in what is now the United States in order to understand the development of imperial U.S. power in both domestic and international contexts. Rather than resting upon a foregone conclusion of European settler colonial “success,” the course explores the contingent and incomplete nature of empire-building even within unbalanced power relationships.","1151":"This survey of twentieth-century US history through the lens of racial capitalism and empire will focus on the United States as a settler state whose power also relies on overseas colonialism and free trade imperialism. Topics include: ideology and political culture, labor and extraction, social movements and resistance, knowledge production and the military-industrial-complex, neoliberal scarcity and financialization.","1152":"History of American law and constitutions from European settlement to the present. Not a comprehensive survey but a study of specific issues or episodes connecting law and history, including morals and marriage laws, slavery, contests over Native American lands, delineations of race and gender, economic regulation, and the construction of a right to privacy.","1153":"With a fifth of the world’s population on a twentieth of its land, the ecosystems of China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam have been thoroughly transformed by human activity. This course will explore the human impact on the environment from the first farmers to the industrial present, exploring how wildlife was eliminated by the spread of agriculture, how states colonized the subcontinent, how people rebuilt water systems, and how modern communism and capitalism have accelerated environmental change. Each week we will examine primary sources like paintings, essays, maps and poems. The course assumes no background in Asian or environmental history.","1154":"Can law change rivers? Do rivers shape law? This course uses the Yukon River—running 2000 miles through Arctic and Subarctic Alaska and Canada—to explore how Indigenous, Russian and British Imperial, and nation-state sovereignties and the legal ideas they contain interacted with ecological and social life. From salmon and migratory birds to wildfires, plastic pollution, and climate change, the course covers the 1800s-2000s. Tuesday lectures will alternate with collaborative readings &amp; short writing assignments based on primary sources, including oral histories, court transcripts, and government documents on Thursdays, with the goal of building new ways of linking law, sovereignty, and ecological change. Readings will be supplemented with secondary works of history, anthropology, theory, ecology, and guest visits from regional experts and Elders. Previous coursework in history, Native American &amp; Indigenous Studies, or ecology is a plus but not required.","1155":"This course examines the creation and circulation of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe, ca. 1450-1600. We will explore the practices, materials, and ideas not just of astronomers and natural philosophers, but also of healers, botanists, astrologers, alchemists, and artisans. How did social, political, economic, and artistic developments during this period reshape how naturalists proposed to learn about, collect, manipulate, and profit from nature? We will also consider the ways in which colonial projects forced Europeans to engage with other “ways of knowing” and rethink classical knowledge systems. P","1156":"This course examines the development of science and related fields in the period sometimes called 'the scientific revolution'. It will both introduce the student to what happened, and ask some questions about causes and effects. The new science is often associated with figures like Harvey, Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, Leeuwenhoek, and Newton. But it is also associated with new ways of assessing nature that are mingled with commerce. The question of the relationship between developments in Europe and elsewhere is therefore also explored. P","1157":"The course will trace the origins and trajectory of ideas about artificial intelligence, starting with the “active intellect” of Aristotle, early analog computers and automata, Ada Lovelace’s “calculus of the nervous system,” through the “general intellect” and “machine capital” of Karl Marx, Karel Čapek’s “Universal Robots,” the “Turing test,” “cyberpositivity” and Donna Haraway’s “Cyborg Manifesto,” and concepts like “swarm intelligence,” “singularity,” and the “black box” problem. Sources will encompass a range of disciplinary approaches (philosophy, sociology, computer science, etc.), formats (text, film, graphic novel), and genres including Japanese anime and Afrofuturism.","1158":"This combined lecture\/discussion course explores the relation between politics and the emotions from Sigmund Freud’s discovery of the unconscious in Vienna around 1900 to the rise of populist and anti-democratic politics in the United States and Europe today. Historical knowledge generally focuses on civilizations, societies, systems, and events as they move, evolve, and transform through time. Psychoanalytic knowledge added the inner, mental (psychic) lives of people and cultures. Psychoanalysis redefined the humanities, the social sciences, and their relationships, paving the way as well for new approaches such as gender and sexuality studies. We will focus on the role of psychoanalysis as a political science, attuned to the modes of mass and media politics of the 20th and 21st centuries.","1159":"Interested students must register for CLAS 1320 .","1160":"Interested students must register for CLAS 1210 .","1161":"Interested students must register for ITAL 1262 .","1162":"Too frequently understood only as a geopolitical anomaly and foreign relations battleground, Taiwan has a rich history as a complex site of overlapping geographies and shifting spatial imaginations. These include indigenous geographies; non-human environments; human circulation and migration in the Pacific and Southeast, East, and Northeast Asia; successive eras of European and Asian colonization and empire; and twentieth century regional and global communities of politics, labor, affect, and more. We’ll approach these histories via scholarly writing, film, music, literature, digital visualizations, and other sources.","1163":"Through films and documentaries about places with contentious histories and ongoing political conflicts, this course will examine the solidarities and fractures that resistance against colonial and foreign control brings about in struggling societies. We will particularly engage with themes around sovereignty and self-determination, nationality and belongingness, and history and memory. Such questions not only have real-world stakes for peoples' survival and political identities, but also shape in profound ways the imaginations and practices of resistance and solidarity across the globe. Course materials will revolve around struggles of Palestinians, Irish, Kurds, Kashmiris, Tamils, and Indigenous Americans, among others. The primary texts in this course will be films and documentaries that we will watch together as a class. Each week or module will revolve around a one film or documentary. Select readings will supplement themes of each film or documentary.","1164":"A new course in the history and theory of antisemitism from 1850 to the present with an emphasis on Europe and attention to the United States and the Middle East.","1165":"“Women in Early Modern China” explores the changes in the roles of women and the definition of gender relations that mark the early modern period (roughly, late fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries) in Chinese history. These changes were crucial to the conceptions of women and their place in society that shaped the modern feminist movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Throughout the course we will be thinking about gender relations as relationships of power: about how power was gendered in political, economic, social, and cultural institutions and spheres; and about how the intersection of gender with class, religious belief, and medicine shaped power relationships. We will also be particularly attentive to women’s participation in these power relationships—that is, the ways in which they could (and did) reinforce, manipulate, exploit, subvert, or resist them.","1166":"The goal of this seminar is to build a community of researchers in the history of China and the Sinophone world, with a focus on understanding the relationships between self, social frameworks, and human geography in the modern era. We'll discuss critical methodologies and research ethics for conducting and using oral interviews; contextualizing and reading archives and a range of published and unpublished documents; understanding material culture; and problems of interpreting evidence at scale. Students will work on their own research project, which could be a paper, film, zine, website, etc. Ability in a spoken or written Chinese language strongly encouraged.","1167":"Cross-dressing knights, virgin saints, homophobic priests, and mystics who speak in the language of erotic desire are but some of the medieval people considered in this seminar. This course examines how conceptions of sin, sanctity, and sexuality in the High Middle Ages intersected with structures of power in this period. While the seminar primarily focuses on Christian culture, it also considers Muslim and Jewish experience. Enrollment limited to 20. P","1168":"This course examines England's mid-seventeenth century revolution, looking at high and low politics, the rise of popular radicalism, and the conflict in the empire. Themes explored include: the trial of Charles I: the commonwealth, 1649-53; the Ranters and the sexual revolution; the Digger commune a Stt. George's Hill; Oliver Cromwell's war crimes in Ireland; Cromwell as Lord protector, 1653-58; the social and gender egalitarianism of the Baptists, Quakers, and Fifth Monarchists; the revolutions in the Caribbean and Atlantic; and the Western Design and capture of Jamaica.","1169":"There were multiple forms of slavery in the Early Modern world. We will look at three major systems: Mediterranean slavery and the Barbary Corsairs, Black Sea slavery and slave elites of the Ottoman Empire, and the Atlantic triangular trade. We will examine the religious, political, racial, and economic bases for these slave systems, and compare the experiences of individual slaves and slave societies. Topics discussed include gender and sexuality (e.g. the institution of the Harem and the eunuchs who ran it), the connection between piracy and slavery, and the roles of slavery in shaping the Western world. P","1170":"In this course we will examine in detail one of the deadliest and most perplexing phenomena of the twentieth century: Stalinism. During Joseph Stalin’s reign the people of the Soviet Union experienced events of astonishing scale and revolutionary change. Rapid industrialization, massive collectivization, famine, purges, state terror, devastating world war, and foreign occupation brought unprecedented suffering and premature death to tens of millions of Soviet citizens. Given the size of the topic and the limited hours in a semester, this course focuses on Stalin’s rise to power and his reign in the 1930s. Rather than surveying the views of a wide range of scholars, we will delve into two very long works of recent scholarship in depth. This is a reading intensive course.","1171":"This course will concentrate on European thinkers' engagement with the politics of the 20th century. Discussion will cover a range of cultural and intellectual currents and ideologies—modernism, fascism, communism, &quot;dissidence,&quot; &quot;internal&quot; migration, &quot;anti-politics&quot;—as well as genres (essays, letters, fiction, criticism, poetry, film).","1172":"When and why did the Middle East emerge as a field of study? What are the competing approaches to framing our understanding of this pivotal region? How did these approaches change over time? This upper-level seminar explores these questions within the larger context of colonial, national, and other ongoing encounters that have shaped modern regimes of knowledge production. The class features visits by leading scholars from different disciplines who reflect on the questions they ask and how they go about answering them. Readings range from canonical works to innovative new scholarship. No pre-requisites but previous coursework on this region recommended.","1173":"The history of finance has become a crucial site for studying governance and statecraft, for recovering the organizing logic of capitalism, and for recognizing the structures of power in any given society. Topics include the recurring debates over metallic and paper currencies, the emergence of a national banking system, and the technologies of coinage, assaying, and counterfeiting. Particular focus on the relationship of finance and slavery, as well as the many “bank wars” that riled American politics from the seventeenth century through the nineteenth century.","1174":"The digital revolution is transforming the study of history. But is it allowing us to better recover the voices and lived experiences of people in the past? This course considers the possibilities and pitfalls of using digital tools to understand the lives of enslaved men and women in the Americas between 1500 and 1800. Each session considers a different digital humanities project, supplemented by primary sources and recent books. For their final project, students will contribute to the Database of Indigenous Slavery in the Americas, which is hosted here at Brown. There are no prerequisites for this course. P","1175":"This course develops a deep reading knowledge of significant issues and themes that define African American experiences in the 20th century, experiences that begin with the years following Emancipation and culminates with the election of President Obama. Themes include citizenship, gender, labor, politics, and culture. The goal is to develop critical analysis and historiographical depth. Some background in twentieth century United States history is preferred but not required. Assignments include weekly reading responses, class participation and presentation, and two written papers. Enrollment limited to 20.","1176":"South Asia is one of the most densely populated geographical regions of the world. The traditional environmentalist view of separating\/protecting ‘nature’ from human settlements often leads to conflicts of resources\/land use here. This course studies the evolution of environmental governance in the diverse ecologies of South Asia across four substantive and methodological parts. Part I involves readings on environmental and agrarian systems in the Mughal Empire from the precolonial period (1526-1757) in South Asia. Part II involves readings on forestry laws from the British colonial period (1757-1947) in South Asia. Part III involves reviewing a series of books and films on environmental history in Asia. Part IV involves researching case studies focusing on local environment cultures from the postcolonial period (1947 to present) in South Asia. The course requires writing a final research paper based on a case study.","1177":"What is an empire? What does an empire do? What is the difference between imperialism and colonialism? How have historical actors as well as historians between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries answered these questions? This seminar considers the long history of intellectual debate over imperialism and its relationship with state formation, capitalism, labor, subjecthood, and the environment. We will read proponents of imperial expansion, advocates of imperial reform, and fierce critics of imperialism. Readings will include canonical texts authored by major historical figures such as John Locke and Vladimir Lenin as well as pamphlets and legislative debates that document the everyday practice of imperialism. In engaging with such primary sources, we will consider how rival visions of imperialism shaped ideological traditions as diverse as liberalism, fascism, conservatism, and communism.","1178":"As the modern world developed and grew, the question of the Jews’ place within it became increasingly important for the majority societies and the Jews themselves to deal with. The solutions found have ranged from inclusion on equal terms through exclusion not only from society but from humanity altogether. In many ways, the debates around this issue have touched on the very meaning of modernity itself. In this advanced undergraduate seminar, we will examine the ongoing polemics on the place of the Jews from the perspectives of both the proponents of the different solutions and the Jews themselves.","1179":"This course examines the history of mass incarceration in the Americas, focusing on the relationship between race, policing, and punishment from colonial Latin America to twenty-first century United States. Together, we will explore ways of thinking about the long history of punishment and its relationship to racial and gender politics as well as different forms of labor exploitation, and think about how different temporal and geographic framings help us think in new ways about the history of incarceration and (perhaps) point to new futures. Among the topics we will explore are the ways contemporary carceral regimes have been shaped by the afterlives of slavery; the shifting meanings of rehabilitation; the experiences of incarcerated individuals; the Cold War politics and transnational roots of militarized policing in the United States; and the ways gender, sexuality, and age shape imprisonment across the hemisphere.","1180":"This reading and writing intensive seminar exposes students to the history of economic thought. Each year it is offered, we make our way through a different set of materials that touch upon a variety of topics, including theories of value, property, markets, labor, and inequality. We will also ask how ideas about the relationship between capitalism and other forms of economic production have changed over time. In the Fall of 2024, we will discuss the deep history of Surveillance Capitalism.","1181":"This course explores 20th-century efforts to address population growth and family planning in a variety of global contexts, ranging from macro-level initiatives to individual practices. For some women, state leaders, and international experts, contraception meant sexual liberation, increased autonomy, and the reduction of economic hardship. But for others, the same biomedical technologies were associated with colonial control and efforts to reduce “undesirable” people. How is it possible for contraception to hold such expansive and contradictory meanings? In order to assess this central question, students will engage with critical theories of gender, race, class, nationalism, and decolonization.","1182":"This course examines the relationships among sex, gender, race, disease and modern medicine in the Americas. Together, we will explore ways of thinking about disease and public health as topics of historical inquiry, and examine how health politics have been shaped by processes of imperialism, sexuality, and racial inequality. From nineteenth-century obstetrical experiments on enslaved women, to more recent debates over the disease threat posed by Haitians during the HIV\/AIDS pandemic, race and sexuality have both shaped the development of medical knowledge and been used to isolate certain groups as threats. Social concerns over women’s bodies and reproductive capacities have also shaped medical research and public health policy across the hemisphere. Through shared readings and guided independent research, this course gives students an opportunity to explore a wide variety of topics related to the history of medicine, race, and gender.","1183":"Interested students must register for HMAN 1973N .","1184":"Interested students must register for COLT 1310J .","1185":"Interested students must register for AFRI 1330 .","1186":"Interested students must register for ENVS 1820 .","1187":"Prospective honors students are encouraged to enroll in HIST 1992 during semesters 5 or 6.

Required for all first-year PhD students in History.","1192":"“The Roots of History” encourages critical thinking about some of the different ways in which historians approach thinking and writing about the past. In particular, we will explore some of the major theoretical stances that have influenced the discipline of history. Our focus throughout will be the interplay between theory and practice. By examining how historians have grappled with questions posed by influential thinkers (often working within other fields of knowledge), we will chart the trajectory of the discipline and assess its working methods. Required for all first-year PhD students in History.","1193":"Required of all 3rd semester Ph.D. students.","1194":"This graduate seminar is about the professional skills, tools, and careers of historians—from hallmark best practices to new directions. We will engage different kinds of careers historians are pursuing today, the practical skills and resources necessary to meet them, and how historians are deploying those skills in multiple professional arenas, both in and beyond the academy. We shall also discuss some of the prevalent (although often unwritten) social and cultural norms of academia and university life to prepare you to navigate your training, career, and various institutional contexts that accompany and follow completion of a Ph.D. in History","1195":"This collaborative seminar focuses on identifying and contextualizing a dissertation topic; choosing a dissertation committee and a support network; designing and executing plans for research and writing; and articulating a thesis project as a prospectus, grant proposal, and other oral and written forms. This is a required course for and open only to third-year students in the History Ph.D. program.","1196":"This course will introduce graduate students to major themes and problems in the field of environmental history. Topics may include climate, animals, the Anthropocene, empire, capitalism, comparative history, marine spaces, and the intersection of cultural, social, and gender history with the environment field, but will be chosen in part based on the interests of enrolled students. Readings will draw from classics and newly published material. Geography and time period are expansive. Discussion will use these works to ground major historiographical questions in environmental history, as well as issues of method, evidence, and narrative style.","1197":"Far from describing the merely recent past, the term modernity often signifies a distinct epoch in the human past. In this course, we will consider what historians studying various, distinct geographies mean by the modern period as well as what their choices might tell us about historical approaches to periodization and scales of analysis. Particular emphasis will be placed on past and present debates about the long nineteenth century as a threshold to modernity. We will consider major historiographical interventions on the Industrial Revolution, the Great Divergence, imperialism, nationalism, and mass politics and culture.","1198":"This course is a wide-ranging readings course in the field of African history. Readings will concentrate on, but not be restricted to, sub-Saharan Africa and the colonial and post-colonial periods. Taking a roots of history\/new directions approach, the seminar will feature classic and recent works in economic, cultural, social, and environmental history. All graduate students welcome.","1199":"This graduate seminar examines the cultural, economic, political, and social history of Black women in the United States from slavery to the Civil Rights-Black Power era. Through a variety of secondary and primary sources, film and other multimedia, the course explores the myriad ways these women have experienced and resisted the “double burden” of racism and sexism in United States history. The course will consider the legacy of slavery and how African American women have defined their own identities as individuals, wives, mothers, community leaders, activists, and theorists. Paying careful attention to their diverse experiences, the course will examine Black women’s participation and leadership in a variety of institutions, organizations, and social movements. Major course themes include labor, class, politics, radicalism, feminism, internationalism, religion, sexuality, violence, and family.","1200":"This PhD-level readings seminar has two primary objectives. The first is to read widely in the recent literature of Native American and Indigenous History, including monographs and articles (readings admittedly tilt towards North America, but with a keen eye to other regions). The second aim is to engage the question of methods, epistemologies, and ways of knowing, both through traditional academic writing as well as Indigenous scholarship that models supplemental and even alternate epistemologies and understandings of what it means to do history and know about the past. As part of this class, we will hear directly from 2-3 Native and Indigenous scholars and knowledge keepers to help us think more critically about where the field is and where it should go.","1201":"This seminar focuses on close readings of several iconic and influential texts on oppression and resistance in the modern era. Despite our growing awareness of the legacies and current realities of oppression, the deeper history of the mobilization of resistance to pervasive oppression in the past has become obscured by the passage of time, and misunderstood through selective citation and decontextualization. By carefully analyzing and contextualizing the writings by earlier generations we can thus better understand our own time, how we got to where we are, and how we can steer our future to safer and more just shores. Some great minds in the past have thought about the questions that concern us today. This course introduces students to these voices in the belief that they can serve as a guide to grasp the complexities of our own time.","1202":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","1203":"This seminar is for History PhD students in residence at Brown who are post-exams and are at any stage of writing their dissertations. It is intended to support dissertators by providing a structured community for setting and sharing goals, writing, and discussing chapters-in-progress. It meets every other week and is a half credit S\/NC course.","1204":"This course is an introduction to South Asian Art &amp; Architecture, from 2500 BCE until the present, and to Southeast Asian Arts connected to them through religion, trade, or conquest. We will explore a range of media—including architecture, painting, sculpture, textiles, and photography—to ask critical questions about the nature of images and their relationship to emotions, the environment, devotion, politics, performance, and other art forms, like literature, music, and dance. The course will include regular visits to the RISD museum (A)","1205":"This course surveys the rise of photography in the art world in the period after 1960. It examines both the development of photography as an independent medium and the appropriation of lens-based imagery by Pop Art, conceptual art, minimalism, and eventually Postmodernism.","1206":"The class introduces students to basic tools and strategies in architectural design. A warmup exercise and several design assignments guide students to explore questions about form, function, structure, and light. The semester is devoted to the design of a small house. Students are trained in rigorous, conceptual thinking and graphically and verbally clear pronunciation of consequential design logic. By the end of the semester, the proposed building design is presented in concept diagrams, plans, sections, elevations, and a model. Course is intended for first and second year students.

Urban planning strategies are developed to carefully insert the proposed building into a hybrid, densely populated urban context within a city. Students will be briefed to either design a residential housing project or a large public building. Students will analyze the built environment and character of the site to create contextual building designs that strengthen a neighborhood. The final presentation will require a complete set of drawings, renderings, a shared urban context model, and a large-scale model of the proposed building design. A jury of invited architects and professors will conduct a discussion of each project in an exhibition-like setting at the List Art Center. This course can be repeated once for credit.","1209":"From rural temple to urban shrine, to elegant synagogue or village church, from household prayer nook to adorned tomb, people in the ancient world honored, encountered, and experienced their gods. They practiced a piety in which human flourishing depended on gestures, rituals, and built articulations of devotion mediated by beauty. But holy powers could also be malevolent, so ancient art served to protect, warn, or ward off evil spirits. This course will explore the art, architecture, and material cultures of ancient Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians between the 6th century BCE and the 6th century CE. We will consider a wide variety of evidence, including texts, sculpture, frescoes, mosaics, architecture, and domestic artifacts, to explore the many ways in which these distinct but connected communities expressed their beliefs through visual representations and material practices.","1210":"The &quot;classic&quot; period of European and American modern architecture from the turn of the century to the 1950s.

Over the course of the semester, we will examine design proposals by architects, landscape architects, and urban planners which respond to a range of concerns about public space and public health. As a part of our study, we will explore topics including urban planning, and policy strategies proposed by Olmsted, Howard, Burnham, le Corbusier to address to fears about urban density, immigration, and contagion; the effect of treatment protocols for infectious diseases like tuberculosis (hygiene, fresh air, sunlight) on the evolution of the work of designers including Aalto, Neutra, Eames, and others.","1212":"This seminar is about how artists imagine the land, and the relationship between people and the places that they inhabit. We will think broadly about how people have conceptualized “nature,” the “landscape,” and “colonization” from the eighteenth century to today as well as hone in on specific artistic traditions, including those in Africa, Europe, and South Asia and across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. This class will investigate materials that come from the land, such as oil, clay, and pigments; other aspects of the environment, like waterways and clouds; and other art forms, including music, fiction, and dance.

The perspectives of the makers of a work of art, patrons and artists, tend to get greater attention in art historical inquiries, in large part because those agents leave more visible traces in the literary and material records. Yet the agency of viewers, although less apparent, can be recovered through careful examination of diverse types of evidence—textual, archaeological, visual—and by relying on viewer-centered theoretical models such as phenomenology and reception theory.

We follow five historical contexts bridging Spain and Portugal, West Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and North America, including: (1) Iberian-Ottoman rivalry from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean and European colonization of the Americas; (2) transatlantic slave trade and the roots of African-American Islam; (3) the U.S. Founders’ ideas about Muslims and religious freedom, plus diplomatic engagement with Morocco, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia; (4) large-scale immigration of Asian Muslims following the 1965 Civil Rights Act; and (5) racialization of Muslim Americans — and oft-misidentified minorities including Arab, Iranian, Sikh, Jewish, Black, and Latinx Americans — before and after 9\/11 and U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.","1221":"A cascading catastrophe threatens to turn the earth uninhabitable and bring our world to its end. How to think, in this context, the relation between our world, the world, and the earth? Are they known, experienced, shared with others, or being destroyed in the same way? How have their differences and convergence been affected by globalization, and affected our understanding of the “Anthropocene&quot;? Following the news on ongoing and future climate catastrophes, the seminar addresses these and related questions through critical readings of theoretical and philosophical texts, including works by Arendt, Latour, Haraway, Povinelli, Yussof, Moore, and Mbembe.","1222":"What does it mean to breathe together, to con-spire? The seminar will start by outlining the long history of the concept of conspiracy, from its pneumatic meanings in Antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero) to the contemporary mediasphere. This will lead us to interrogate what remains of the possibility of a shared breathing in the era of climate change, gas warfare, and privat(izat)ion of air: Peter Sloterdijk’s notion of “atmoterrorism” or Elias Canetti’s idea of a “breath economy” will be brought into conversation with M. nourbeSe Philip’s writing of the “ga(s)p” or Clarice Lispector’s Breath of Life; Edgar Poe’s apneic imagination in “Loss of Breath” will resonate against the racial politics of spirometry.

In public and closed spaces, actors leverage narratives, venues, dress, gestures, images, and soundscapes to sustain relations with others, pursue security goals, and affect the world they live in. At the intersection of the humanities and social sciences, this course foregrounds practices and designs that are constitutive of the international stage and world politics. They encompass everyday interactions as well as protocol-driven scenes, mediatized moments, and spectacular occasions. The course draws case studies from a range of historical and global contexts, from the early modern era to the present, to shed light on key forms of international society and worldmaking, from the diplomatic list to the negotiation table to the group portrait.","1226":"Digital humanities uses digital methodologies and formats to answer humanities research questions, produce and share knowledge, and teach. It encompasses critical studies of digital environments, innovative modes of researching and advancing arguments (including methodologies for constituting archives, analyzing texts and images, and visualizing data), new forms of scholarly and general publications, and digital pedagogy. The digital changes the way we research, understand, and share information in the humanities. This course will introduce students to a range of methodologies and critical lenses. Students will learn to collect resources formatted for machine-actionable research, analyze qualitative and quantitative datasets, and visualize and present their findings. They will consider the ethics of digital work and publication. Each student will plan a digital humanities project.

What archival methods are necessary to mine the gaps? Facilitated by two cultural studies scholars, one located in American Studies and the other in Hispanic studies, this collaborative humanities seminar tackles the archive as an institution, a practice, and a methodology through the tools of queer studies, critical race theory, gender theory, media studies, and postcolonial studies. We will study archive theory through methodological discussions and hands-on practice with Brown’s special collections at John Hay Library. We will engage the work of key scholars in the field of archival studies, such as Saidiya Hartman, Anjali Arondekar, Marisa J. Fuentes, and Zeb Tortorici. Assignments will consist of short and long essays, responses to archival materials, group presentations, and the organization of a one-day public symposium.","1231":"What is a face? Faces are generally considered unique to the being they belong to — usually a human being, since animals tend to be denied access to faciality. Indeed, face, understood as singularity, is for Emmanuel Levinas what grounds the ethical relation to the other. But faces, as deepfakes have shown, are also utterly replicable: they can be grafted, mimicked, appropriated, forged. Our collaborative humanities seminar will delve into the representations of faces (portraits, self-portraits, selfies, close-ups), the classification of faces (Johann Kaspar Lavater’s physiognomy, the iconography of hysteria, Cesare Lombroso’s Criminal Man), the staging of faces (pornography), the racial politics of faces (Blackface, facial recognition, Frantz Fanon’s notion of mask), and the philosophy of “faceity” (Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben).","1232":"Interested must for register for POBS 2400 or MCM2510O.","1233":"Empires — ancient, early modern, and contemporary — have profoundly shaped the distribution of wealth and power in the modern world. However, imperial formations are strikingly diverse, and many of the entities that scholars now call “empires” were not understood as such during their own times. This collaborative humanities graduate seminar explores that diversity and examines how empires rise, fall, and perdure. While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world. We afford particular attention to local peoples’ relationships with empires, environmental history, political economy, historiography, and imperial art and material culture.","1234":"Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have produced systems that can appear human-level in their ability to generate text and images. This technology opens questions concerning the relationships between the art and philosophy of language and computation as cultural infrastructure. This seminar will explore how technology and humans interact via language, and what it means for humans and for AI to read and to write. The format of this collaborative humanities seminar will emphasize in-class discussion. Readings will comprise a mix of literature, including digital literature, theory, and philosophy of language. Participants will not be required to have a background in computer science or technology, but will experience tutorials on key technical concepts in order to enable them to think critically about cutting-edge developments in AI beyond a superficial level.","1235":"In this seminar we describe and analyze how the colonial order mined the world, focusing mainly on North Africa and South America. Metals are conveyors of powers, and are seated in pre-colonial mythologies, cosmologies, and ways of being in the world. In this collaborative theory\/praxis course we ask with others (Walter Rodney, Eduardo Galeano, or Guamán Poma) how these can be reclaimed through the exercise of the gestures and techniques of below-the-ground materials. What would it mean practically to overturn the histories of plunder, theft, and evacuation and imagine beyond them? A central aspect of the course is to make and visit jewelry as immanent to social and spiritual fabrics. We acknowledge the presences and excesses of the materials we work with and engage these objects beyond the colonial and monocultural imagination.","1236":"In this capstone course, students completing the Doctoral Certificate in Collaborative Humanities pursue individual or collaborative projects, such as a dissertation chapter, an article on method\/theory, or a stand-alone essay related to the larger field. The workshop provides a collaborative and supportive space in which students from different disciplines can share their work and receive and give feedback that will broaden and sharpen the framing of their projects. At the end of the semester, participants present in a Collaborative Public Workshop. Admission to the seminar requires a formal application process and the completion of two HMAN 2400 seminars.","1237":"The seminar examines political theology through critical readings of ancient canonical texts considered foundational in the traditions of Western philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. Texts from Anaximander, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Renaissance musings of Etienne de La Boetie will be read alongside 20th-century thinkers — Carl Schmitt, Pierre Clastres, Cornelius Castoriadis, Regina Schwartz, Jan Assmann, Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler, Bonnie Honig, and others. Can readings of ancient canons be both non-anachronistic and critical? Must critique be secular? Or Gnostic? Can the political be separated from the theological? What can formations of ancient theo-political imagination teach us about the limits of ours?","1238":"This IAPA Gateway course explores the origins and development of the American Tax State in comparative and historical perspective. It's designed as an interdisciplinary introduction to the welter of problems associated with the raising and spending of public revenue –the life blood of contemporary nation-states.

It is designed as an interdisciplinary introduction to the welter of problems associated with the raising and spending of public revenue –the life blood of contemporary nation-states.","1239":"This course presents an interdisciplinary approach to the study of development. The course examines what constitutes development from a variety of different disciplinary perspectives, and the course examines how and in what context the term “development” itself has evolved over time. The goal of this course is to provide students an intellectual and conceptual grounding for study a variety of issues surrounding development, whether in the global North or South.","1240":"An overview of policymaking and policy analysis in the contemporary United States. The course begins with an examination of traditional justifications for government action. We will then examine the discipline of policy analysis that has arisen to design and evaluate public policies. We will also consider critiques of the rational method and ask questions about how policy expertise fits into the political system. The course ends with classic works on organizations and implementation. Not open to graduate students.","1241":"This course introduces students to contemporary international security topics with a special focus on problems associated with war and violent conflict in the 21st century. It mixes the theoretical, historical, analytical, and practical. Students learn theory on the causes of war, how wars are fought, civil-military relations, the costs and consequences of warfare, and more. They also learn about the organization of the U.S. and other national security establishments. Using these tools, we will apply social science methods and critical thinking to security “hot spots” and wars around the world. There will be an emphasis on analyzing the unfolding war in Ukraine, as well as the prospects for U.S.-China rivalry and\/or military conflict in the future, including within a Taiwan scenario. Aside from readings, lectures and discussions, students will benefit from a variety of films, simulations, walking excursions, and debates.","1242":"Social Entrepreneurship, engages students in the process of exploring significant global problems and developing innovative solutions that drive transformative social change. The course helps students understand the strategies that social entrepreneurs employ to tackle complex and entrenched social problems with transformative approaches that work and impact systems. Students will learn about real organizations and interact with entrepreneurs leading this work. Case studies, complemented by articles and guest speakers, will show different approaches to social entrepreneurship and illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of various models and strategies.","1243":"Contemporary nonprofits and their role in community building and shaping public policy are central to this course. Topics include how strong coalitions impact housing, welfare and children's policy, organizing empowered communities, the influential and engaged donor and building the value of nonprofits.

Topics include: the historical legacy, why Latin America fell behind, import substitution industrialization, the debt crisis, poverty and income inequality, inflation, trade and financial liberalization and competitiveness. The class exposes students to a number of concepts and tools that can be broadly applied to the understanding of development in other geographic areas.","1246":"For many people, their image of the Caribbean is the tourist brochure and television advertisement representation of sun, sea and sand. This course challenges that through a broad introduction to the real society, economy and politics of the Caribbean region. Using literature, film and traditional texts, it captures the cultural and linguistic complexity of the region through the exploration of a range of central themes such as ethnicity, color, class, politics, as well as more specific, targeted areas including economic inequality, migration, and tourism.","1247":"This course introduces students to ethnographic research methods as a capacious set of tools for understanding the diverse ways people make sense of social issues that affect their lives and shape their experiences. It also addresses the ethical, legal, and political dilemmas that ethnographers encounter while engaging in field research. The course consists of weekly lectures, fieldwork practice, and ethnographic lab sessions. Students learn how ethnographers design their research projects, undertake participant observation in their chosen field sites (including online), write fieldnotes, prepare for and conduct interviews, collect and analyze artifacts, use visual and audio tools to experiment with multimodality, and work with archives, both historic and contemporary. Throughout the course, students will practice and apply these methods to pursue independent research projects on a topic of their choice. (IAPA Qualitative Research Methods course)","1248":"Public and non-profit sector resources are limited, and decisions about how to allocate scarce resources must be informed by an understanding of the impact of social programs and policies. However, measuring impact can be a challenge. This course provides a broad – yet rigorous – overview of the methods and tools available for evaluation of the impact of public and non-profit sector programs. Students become familiar with the concepts and methods of program evaluation. They gain knowledge and skills relevant to the planning and implementation of process and impact evaluations. We cover the pros and cons of various methods, including experimental and quasi-experimental designs, qualitative methods and mixed methods. Students will also learn how to critically review evaluation methods and findings. We will use real-life examples and case studies from a range of substantive areas to support and promote course learning.","1249":"This is a course about how major powers make, maintain and potentially undermine themselves using several recent examples -- Great Britain, the United States, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan. We make no claims that this course will reveal clues about the end of the American Empire, or the Pax Americana, but we do argue that only through an honest accounting of the history of the political economy of strategy can students understand both the costs and benefits of hegemony.","1250":"Urbanization has been a driving force behind social change and economic growth. It has also been a deeply political process, in which urban space is distributed and its development subject to state regulation. This course examines the politics of urban development through international comparisons, primarily between the United States and China, but with reference to India and Brazil as well. Addressing in turn land takings, the governance of urban development, and informality in urban development, this course is an opportunity to identify commonalities and differences in urbanization processes across the world. (IAPA Jr seminar)","1251":"This seminar is offered in Washington DC to Brown in Washington students and remotely to students on campus. It examines the practice and profession of diplomacy and its relationship to the policy process. While the practice of diplomacy and the policy-making process has a U.S. focus, the lessons learned apply to other nation states as well. We briefly review the history of inter-state relations, including the international legal basis for diplomatic relations. Diplomacy has evolved over the years and has been greatly influenced by modern technology; however, it continues to incorporate such common functions as policy formulation, representation, reporting, negotiation, intercultural contacts and interaction with the media, parliamentary bodies and other external actors. The course will provide a knowledge base for understanding the policy process and will expose students to policy analysis, memo writing for decisionmaking, negotiations and verbal communications.","1252":"This course examines why autocratic states democratize and why democracy breaks down in already democratic states. The course analyzes domestic factors (e.g., values, norms, religion, culture, economic development and inequality, natural resources, protests, insurgencies, and coups d’etat,), as well as international ones (e.g., trade, foreign aid, international organizations, and international war). The course also examines the reasons for and the effectiveness of different ways that governments resist democratization, including accommodation, censorship, and repression.","1253":"This seminar examines the historical roots of --and contemporary debates over-- select but fundamental issues in the finance, regulation, and governance of public education. Our focus is on the American expression of these issues and debates. But we will look to the experience of other multilevel democracies to highlight conceptual and institutional differences that are of theoretical interest and perhaps of practical use. In particular, the seminar will explore how the goals of education as a public good get defined; the history of school finance and governance in America; the ways in which ‘school choice’ has intersected in practice and in theory with segregation, integration, and debates over mechanisms to improve school quality; on the problems of test-based accountability regimes; and on the role teacher training systems in educational improvement.","1254":"This course will explore two international relations missions—diplomacy and development cooperation-- that complement one another but differ in substance and nature. Diplomacy, comprised of statecraft, policy formulation, representation, reporting and negotiation, will be treated in opening segments. The diplomatic mission is about influencing other sovereign states to bridge national differences in an effort to promote interests and avoid conflict. The course will explore these aspects using simulations, including a mock negotiation, a congressional hearing, and other pedagogical approaches.","1255":"Income and wealth inequality in America are at their highest levels in a century. Historically, one reason Americans have been thought to tolerate inequality is that we tend to believe that our society is a mobile one, where people can easily move from one social class to another. But in recent years, inequality and stagnant social mobility have been associated with increasing social and political distrust and unrest. In this junior seminar, we will examine the economic and political, and ideological factors that have contributed to this historical moment, learn about how Americans experience living in an unequal society, and consider the future of equality and social mobility in the United States. How should our society be shaped, and what are our obligations as members of that society?","1256":"New technologies like smart production, AI, and 5G, are fundamentally changing how we consume and how produce is been produced. This class explores technological innovation to better understand the changing dynamics of the global political economy and relations between the market and the state. It focuses on the concept of smart production as an outgrowth of flexible production, which is changing relationships between the human body and machine, collective and individual data extraction, and their social adaptations. Through an analysis of these transformations, the class will examine how our ideas of scale, especially the concept of “local”, and the meaning of value are being reimagined, and what effect this has on interactions between state, society and market.","1257":"The course will explore the forms and dynamics of popular political participation, engagement, and disengagement, as they have been emerging and evolving in the region of Eastern Europe, which has been defined by popular mobilizations and revolutions as well as authoritarianism, imperialism, and large-scale war. We will analyze the variations, divergences, and commonalities between the social and political contexts of different states with a special focus on Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, whose relations are characterized by intertwined histories, power asymmetries, close connections, and extreme confrontations. By situating the developments in this region within broader global and historical contexts, participants will reflect on the possibilities and dynamics of political and societal change and its trajectories. The course is specifically preoccupied with popular politics and the ways agency is historically forged and structurally conditioned.","1258":"How does the state govern marginalized groups? And how do the processes of state governance—from population-level policies to everyday institutional interactions—intersect to shape the lives of group members? This course will draw primarily on sociological literature and methods to explore theories and case studies of governance at the margins, highlighting the role of state institutions from courts and prisons to hospitals and schools. The course material will focus on the governance of low-income Black and Brown families in the United States, though much of what we study will apply to other marginalized groups and contexts as well. As we learn together, we will consider the implications of various modes of governance for the reproduction of social marginality—as well as the possibilities of governance for promoting care and justice.","1259":"This course examines the political sources and ramifications of industrial change, which is closely related to the distribution of wealth between and within nations and the response to global challenges. The course will explore why some nations have been more successful in industrial and technological development and how globalization has affected uneven development. Key topics include the relationship between state and market; institutional sources of comparative advantage; the role of national security; globalization; the debate on industrial policy; and the potential of mobilizing industries to address climate change. The experiences of developed countries, particularly those of the U.S., will be discussed in conjunction with those of developing countries.","1260":"This course leads students to investigate the issue of governance under the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Who govern? Who is governed? What are the typical techniques and institutions of governance, as well as the rationales, ideologies, and interests behind them? Do state-initiated marketization and globalization create discontinuities in socialist governance? Should one understand Beijing’s reinforcement of state sovereignty in the contemporary era as a simple revival of an authoritarian regime, or as more innovative practices? In what ways are governing practices under the Chinese socialist system similar to, or different from, those under liberal democracies? In this seminar course, students will explore these questions through scholarly discussions on governance in the realms of bureaucracy, economic market, technology and media, population, public health, and family. Course materials are drawn from anthropology, political science, sociology, and history.","1261":"In this junior seminar, we will focus our attention on understanding how culture is constructed and mobilized in defining national belonging following racial logics. We will approach the topic on several levels: a macro-level understanding of national identity formation processes and policies, the meso-level of institutional processes playing a part in deploying concepts of national culture, and micro-level experiences and understanding of these politics among everyday citizens. We will explore the nexus between national culture, identity, citizenship, and whiteness in Western nations with a focus on France, the U.S., and possibly others. Students will write and present final papers on a country of their choosing.","1262":"How can we green the global political economy? The seminar provides an understanding of the political economy of a global green transition by discussing the inadequacy of our current efforts and the pathways for future transformation. To capture the interdisciplinarity of environmental issues, the seminar is rooted in political economy, drawing from across political science, economics, sociology, and history. The seminar looks at green transition as a global phenomenon and covers issue areas across finance, industrial policy, trade, and security, with a geographic emphasis on the US, the EU, China, and other global South countries. At the end of the seminar, students will have the skillset to grasp the highly complex nature of a global green transformation.","1263":"Who protests, why, and how? Does collective action matter for social and political change? When does non-violent mobilization escalate into full-blown civil war? Why do some social movements succeed while others decline? The analysis of how people make conflicting collective claims on each other, the state, or on third parties can help us understand why and how different forms of political contention such as social movements, revolutions, and ethnic wars have developed in different times and places with varying degrees of success.","1264":"This course will give students an introduction to business organizations – the law that governs corporations and partnerships, how they raise money in the financial markets, and to explore the public policy issues that inform the regulation of business and finance. We will look at business organizations, law that governs how companies raise money, operation of the stock markets, insider trading, and the regulation of institutional investors including mutual funds, hedge funds and private equity funds. We will finish by taking up corporations as persons, their social obligations and the recent Supreme Court cases on corporations and the First Amendment. Overrides granted based on random drawing for 11 seniors and 8 juniors; to be eligible you must turn in the first week’s assignment and attend the first class. Put course in your cart to access the assignment via canvas.","1265":"Politics in America has never been so manic, so divided, so pervasive, so vital. But we’re not just in overlapping crises of government and democracy and economics and race. We’re also in a crisis of truth. It’s impossible to think about what is happening in politics without thinking about how it’s covered. This course will explore that connection—in a practice-oriented, writing intensive approach which will aim to transform your understanding both of what’s really happening in politics and how those developments are presented to the public. Fulfills IAPA senior capstone\/seminar requirement.","1266":"The seminar course will explore the role that Congress and policy making can play in creating an environment to support or impede innovation in our national security science and technology enterprise. The course will discuss the opportunities and challenges of implementing innovative technologies and practices into the complex defense establishment and understand how policymakers can work to create a legal framework, regulations, culture, and financial resources that can support or inhibit innovation. The course will explore the legislative process, focused on how Congress provides legal authorities and funding, and performs oversight activities over the Pentagon. The course will also examine the complementary roles of the legislative branch, executive branch, and the private sector in shaping the policy and innovation environment.","1267":"When we talk about surveillance, are we thinking of Orwell’s Big Brother, the scenarios portrayed in Black Mirror, or Edward Snowden’s disclosures? Although technological advances have intensified interest in this subject, surveillance is not a recent development; it has been a fundamental element of modernity. In this course, we will start with the theoretical bases for understanding surveillance. The subsequent weeks are divided into three modules, each focusing on a different participant in surveillance: the state, corporations and the emergence of “surveillance capitalism,” and citizens who may embrace, participate in, or resist surveillance. Adopting a global viewpoint, we will explore surveillance practices across various political regimes, throughout different historical periods, and technological advancements. There are no pre-requisites for this seminar.","1268":"Technological innovations are a central force for economic development, but today we are facing some of their most severe and unintended consequences. Some observers argue that only market competition can enable the blossoming of human ingenuity, while others argue that state planning is essential for controlling the dangers inherent in new technologies. Rather than extol or deny the benefits that can come from technology, this course examines how governments in different historical circumstances have attempted to shape and regulate three of the most challenging risks facing advanced societies.","1269":"Disasters, epidemics, and conflicts all pose significant threats to human security, including the very ability for people to meet their basic needs for protection, food, water, shelter, and healthcare. This course will take a pragmatic approach to understanding how the legal, ethical, and technical principles of humanitarian assistance get translated into actual impact on the ground during large-scale emergencies worldwide. In particular, we will explore the justifications and limitations for humanitarian response as a tool for addressing modern challenges ranging from climate change to civil conflict, alongside new efforts to improve both the effectiveness of humanitarian response and its accountability to affected populations. This course will cover a diverse range of topics including the history, structure, and financing of humanitarian response; the public health evidence base for common human security interventions; and the intersections between human rights and humanitarianism.","1270":"Armed conflict significantly affects civilian populations, often on a massive scale, and often in ways that generates large-scale humanitarian crises that can last decades or longer. Professional military organizations today are tasked both with prosecuting war and dealing with the humanitarian consequences. How do armed forces deal with this dual challenge? How do humanitarian organizations? What about governments and the private sector? How do policy makers think about these challenges? What accounts for successes and failures? How do military and civilian organizations interact in these settings, and what can be done to improve their engagements to better save lives and alleviate the suffering of affected populations? How can civilian protection, aid worker security, and humanitarian access efforts be improved upon so that humanitarian crises related to conflict can be more effectively addressed?","1271":"This undergraduate seminar examines war and peace after 1945 through the lens of international relations (IR) theory. It aims to both teach students theoretical perspectives on international relations and to critically evaluate the changing ways in which states have interacted with one another since the end of World War II. What caused the Cold War? Did nuclear weapons change the way that states negotiated with one another? How much did individuals make a difference during interstate crises? Why did states sometimes fail to reach peaceful settlements with one another? What were the experiences of states other than the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War? How have social and economic institutions changed international politics in the twenty-first century?","1272":"Shattering events of 1978-80 in Iran unfolded against the backdrop of the previous decades of Iranian history, knowing that history is essential to understanding the revolution. The revolution cannot be appreciated without studying the enormous effects it's had over the last 35 years. This course places the anti-Shah movement and the rise of religious power in the context of Iran's century of modern history. We conclude by focusing on today's Iran, the upheaval following the 2009 election, reformist president election in 2013, and prospects for reconciliation with the US. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors &amp; seniors. Priority given to IR seniors.","1273":"This course uses both traditional lecture and interactive, mock-trial to give public policy students with the tools to understand, interpret and apply the law as expressed in judicial opinions, particularly the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States.

For the first three weeks, we’ll have an introduction to civil procedure, examining how cases are brought, the requirements for valid claims, including what affects parties’ right to bring a lawsuit, emergency relief, disposition with and without trial, appeals and the principles that the Supreme Court uses in deciding cases. If the seminar is oversubscribed, admission will be by lottery, comprised of students who turn in the first assignment and attend the first class session.","1274":"This course provides students with a comprehensive introduction to exploring challenges and opportunities related to global challenges from both a human and national security perspective – with a special focus on putting people and communities, as opposed to national interests, at the center of attention. Students will gain a deep understanding of key issues including humanitarian crises caused by natural disasters, and the impacts of climate change, food and water security, urbanization, mass migration, and infectious disease\/pandemics on vulnerable people around the world.","1275":"Since the 1970s studies of democratization have shifted from a &quot;global resurgence of democracy&quot; to an &quot;authoritarian resurgence.&quot; This course covers the conceptual tools for understanding these developments. We pay particular attention to the assumptions, biases, knowledge structures, and inferences produced by language and imagery--e.g., oilfields and greenhouses, pendulums and waves, pacts and backsliding--in our understanding of new and emerging threats to democracies across the globe. Includes single case, cross-national comparisons, and big data set studies.

We will then look at various approaches to the text, from (post)structuralist, psychoanalytic and theological interpretations, to then connect the novel to contemporary issues related to ecocriticism, animal studies, posthumanism, and the digital revolution. After reading the novel, the focus will shift to scrutinizing various modern and contemporary retellings, aiming to unravel the relevance of the “Pinocchio myth” today. This prompts an inquiry into the persisting presence of Pinocchio in Western culture and invites contemplation on the reasons behind its continual resurgence. Taught in English.","1284":"What does it mean to resist? This course explores the concept of resistance in its multiple cultural representations. Starting from the partisan Resistance against the Nazi-Fascist regime (1943-45), we will touch upon several historical uprisings: civil rights movements, feminist movements, the so-called Years of Lead, anti-mafia activism, anti-globalization movements, antiracist activism. From literature to film\/tv series, from photography to visual art to poetry, artists have politically engaged, challenged and modified the idea of resistance embedded within the identity of contemporary Italians. We look at artistic expressions of resistance performed against different forms of power (nationalism, the colonial state, the patriarchal family, the Mafia, the Church, police violence). We interrogate how the idea of resistance comes to structure Italian culture today and how it reverberates in mainstream narratives of what it means to be Italian.","1285":"Primarily for students with no knowledge of Italian. Given in English. Concentrators in Italian should enroll in ITAL 1610 ; they are expected to read the material in the original. Close study and discussion of Dante's deployment of systems of retribution in the Inferno and rehabilitation in the Purgatorio with a view to imagining a society based on love and resistant to the effects of nascent capitalism and the money economy.

During a Renaissance of flourishing debate on women ranging from the theater of Machiavelli to the dialogue of Castiglione, women themselves transformed historical feminism, the intellectual and cultural movement that advanced the idea of equality and equal opportunity across genders. Materials include archival documents, treatises, letters, literature and the visual arts. This course is the same as HIST 1931L . (P) Taught in English.","1288":"This course will explore the interweaving of literature and politics in modern and contemporary Italy. We will investigate the intricate ways in which literature reflects and shapes the nation's identity, addressing profound themes such as war, family, religion, race, and sexuality. Through the lens of both celebrated and lesser-known Italian authors like Elena Ferrante, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Elsa Morante, and Italo Calvino, we will delve into the narratives that have influenced Italy's sociopolitical landscape. Complementing our literary exploration, film adaptations offer a vivid counterpoint, illustrating the pervasive influence of literariness in Italian culture.

Participants interested in other geographical, chronological, and disciplinary areas will have ample time to purse their interests. The study of gender has profoundly shaped the practice of history in the last half century, and the course outlines its impact and its transformations. The course places in conversation diverse but overlapping historical developments: the impact of the study of gender on history; influences from beyond history that have shared or shaped historians’ approach to gender and sexuality; the particular inflections of the study of gender in the case of Italy (1400-1800); the impact of the turn to the study of sexuality and queer studies. The course explores and critiques the limits of our gender constructs (theoretical, methodological, and modern) for explaining the culture of people in the premodern world and beyond the western hemisphere, fields of scholarship where the universality of contemporary notions of gender have been challenged.

Enrollment limited to 19 first-year students.","1307":"Interested students must register for RELS 0090F .","1308":"Jewish and Christian identity in Europe has traditionally been closely connected to the ways the two religions view each other. Mutual admiration, influence, and hatred have combined together in a difficult relationship, fundamental to European history. In this course, we will survey that relationship, examining some key issues and events which shaped it. The Jews' attitudes and actions will be examined alongside those of their Christian neighbors. Topics covered include: medieval revulsion and attraction; early modern re-evaluations of Judaism and Christianity; modern Christian anti-Semitism, Jewish diplomacy, and the Holocaust; the effects of Vatican II; Israel and the contemporary Christian world.","1309":"In this seminar we will examine the architecture and art of synagogues, churches, and mosques from antiquity through the present. We will learn how different building traditions evolved over time, and how sacred spaces reflect beliefs and practices of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Of interest will be both unique regional and chronological trends—characteristics that are indicative of a specific religious community—but also the parallels and shared features common to all Abrahamic religions. Special attention will be given to questions of gendered space and the role of patriarchy and women’s agency in shaping religious architectures.","1310":"How was the Bible employed in past moral debates that divided American society, e.g., debates over the legitimacy of slavery?

Texts to be considered include the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), the New Testament, the Dead Sea Scrolls, rabbinic literature, the Kabbalah, records of the Salem Witch Trials, Milton’s Paradise Lost, Goethe’s Faust, the Book of Mormon, contemporary Evangelical literature and New Age writings, and representations of angels and demons in film and television. No prior knowledge of the Bible, Judaism or Christianity is assumed.","1313":"How did a small apocalyptic Jewish movement from the backwaters of the Roman Empire turn into something that “we” might call Christianity? In other words, how and when did Judaism and Christianity “part ways?” While such questions might present themselves as straight-forward investigations into a historical event, they are not, in fact, as innocent as they might first appear. In this course, we will not seek to answer the question of the “Parting of the Ways” as much as we will critique it. Our aim is to reframe this crucial question by reflecting on the categories of religion, conversion, origins, narrative, and history, among others. We will read through a wide variety of ancient literature (including canonical and non-canonical Christian texts, rabbinic literature, Jewish poetry) and broach modern forms of “Jewish Christianity.”","1314":"This seminar offers an interdisciplinary and intersectional examination of the historical and contemporary experiences of Jews from antiquity through the present.

Throughout the course, we will consider how intersections with other social identities – such as race, class, sexuality, and age – inform how people construct gender through language and how these intersections impact which communities have historically been prioritized in research in this area.","1345":"This course provides an overview of the history, structure, and diversity of languages in the United States, focusing on four categories: indigenous, colonial, immigrant, and new languages. It explores how these languages reflect and constitute cultural identity, and the ways in which they are shaped by social, political, and educational factors. The course includes topics like Native American languages, African American English, and American English dialects, including the dialects of New England, and critically examines the connections between language, race, power, and privilege. This is an introductory course and no prior linguistics training is required.","1346":"Examines some of the classic and current issues regarding sound structure in the world's languages and introduces the theoretical tools needed to solve them. After an introduction to articulatory phonetics and phonemic analysis, it focuses on phonological analysis of different languages, and discusses rule-based and constraint-based approaches to phonology. Implications for language learning and language change are discussed. Prerequisite: LING 0100 .","1347":"As anyone who has tried to learn a foreign language knows, languages differ from one another in numerous ways both superficial and profound. Although there are many different ways in which syntactic structure varies across languages, this variation is not limitless; it is subject to principled constraints, and different logically independent dimensions of variation often turn out to be highly correlated with one another. This course explores language universals and the range of cross-linguistic variation in the domain of morphosyntax, what limits this variation appears to have, and what functional, formal, and semantic principles underlie this variation.","1348":"The representation of word meaning and generalizations about the way in which meanings are packaged into words. Topics include: \"fuzzy\" meanings, natural kind terms, how word meanings are decomposed. Special emphasis on how temporal properties are encoded, on the status of \"thematic relations,\" and on how the fine-grained structure of word meanings impacts on the syntax. Recommended prerequisite: CLPS 0030 .","1349":"This course explores historical, cultural, and theoretical perspectives on the relationship between language and ethnicity, and related concepts such as race, with a special focus on the United States. It centers on class discussions informed by readings that examine how language reflects and defies ethnic boundaries and how ideas about ethnicity influence the ways people use and construe language. The course covers topics such as ethnicization, racialization, authentication, linguistic repertoire, style shifting, mocking, ideology, and the concept of the listening subject. Requirements include attendance, participation, essays, class presentations, and a final paper. Students will gain experience in collecting and interpreting linguistic data and enhance their ability to write about language from a social scientific perspective, with the opportunity to incorporate feedback into their writing. Prerequisites: LING 0100 \/ CLPS 0300 , LING 0511 \/ CLPS 0340 , or LING 0530 \/ CLPS 0370 .","1350":"In this course, we will explore how language meets social information in the mind. We will address questions like: How do we infer who someone is from the way that they speak? How do our social expectations influence speech perception? How do our social experiences, stereotypes, and attitudes mediate how we speak and how we listen? How does our knowledge of linguistic variation interact with cognitive processes like attention and memory? And how much control do we have over these phenomena? Students will gain both a theoretical understanding of research in these areas as well as practical knowledge related to formulating research questions and designing studies on sociolinguistic topics.","1351":"Information theory is used to study the abstract properties of communication systems. Can it improve our ability to understand language? We will examine how the need to communicate predicts several linguistic phenomena. We will discuss information theoretic effects on multiple levels of linguistic analysis, including phonetics, phonology, and syntax. We will contrast concepts such as frequency, predictability, informativity, and functional load, and see how they can each apply to existing linguistic questions.","1352":"A lab\/practicum course introducing the methodologies needed to collect, manage, and interpret primary data pertaining to the phonetic, phonological, morphosyntactic, semantic, and pragmatic properties of an understudied language.

Amid the tangible, we recognize the intangible and ephemeral matter, such as oral histories, songs, missing records, objects lost in migration now only filed in memory. how do we open a creative space for these often undervalued inventories? In this class we shall read several texts of poetry and hybrid nonfiction that grapple with familial documents &amp; materials, while, at the same time, beginning our own archival projects. We shall raise questions about the kind of research this project entails, the ethics of writing about kin, how to work creatively with photographs, audio, objects and documents, and how to write into that empty gap of what's missing from the archive.","1378":"Creative Writing can be understood as a method of turning ideas, sounds, images, snippets, fragments, dreams, research -- and any and all of life's materials -- into fully realized literary works. The &quot;work&quot; of these works is hidden when we read books and published authors, and thus our sense of how excellent work is achieved can be underdeveloped or perfectionistic. When we rely on only a reader's perspective to guide us as artists, it provides little to no sense of artistic path. The path that an artist takes to develop a work is one that is non-linear, messy, and full of wonderful byways. It doesn't easily fit into an editorial perspective, and thus the way in which work is discussed will be different from literature courses. This workshop is for writers of all levels to explore in more depth their","1379":"What do an artist and a politician have in common? One person might say that they both make things up. Another might claim that both aim to tell truths that unite audiences. Bearing this genre-related ambiguity in mind, this course will explore the description of illiberal and anti-progressive political ideals and systems—particularly, although not exclusively, in narrative fiction. This class is therefore also about the strategies politicians, novelists, and others use to shape our sense of what is real and to argue for particular accounts of what is valuable, just, and possible, as well as how human life should be led. We will consider the work of Margaret Atwood, Octavia Butler, Philip K. Dick, Bret Easton Ellis, Colleen Hoover, R.F.

Lawrence once wrote, &quot;Tragedy is like strong acid–it dissolves away all but the very gold of truth.&quot; A journey through major, sudden trauma is the more familiar literary route to the excavation of such truth, but what of the quotidian grief that accompanies something as constant as climate change or as much of a slow-drip as the aging process? How do we write about grief that the world doesn't quite accept as grief? How do we use our writing to build a bridge away from isolation, and towards the universal well of compassion for others? In this class, we'll be culturing the pearls of such ambient grief, isolating what we can in order to examine the way ambient grief reshapes our sense of ourselves and sharpens our sense of the world beyond.","1381":"Offers students an introduction to the study of literature (including works from more than one genre) with special attention given to a writer's way of reading.

This is a question most novelists approach with dread, because, a) all the good plots and structures have been used up; b) plots can feel annoying anyway, like a capitulation to cinema or theater; and c) nevertheless, it is impossible to write in total darkness. We’ll dispel this darkness by reading works by a range of novelists. How do these authors strike a balance between complex thought and elegant\/unusual structure? And how can we, as writers, maintain narrative coherence over the course of hundreds of pages?","1383":"We will study writing and, more generally, language art in terms of reading, both reexamining theories and practices of writing — in linguistics, the philosophy of language, and in the actual making of literature — and also by proposing that reading is constitutive of language regardless of its medium.

The body has been always an object of imagination, literature, science, philosophy, and religion, it is the vehicle of both the divine and the profane, and it is at the center of debates on sexuality, gender identities, race, and politics. In this course, we look at how different views on the body and on sexuality developed and changed throughout the medieval period and how they influenced and were influenced by the religious doctrines, medical theories, and the intellectual environment of different groups of people. Finally, we will explore bodies both physical and metaphorical.","1441":"Interested students must register for COLT 0510K .","1442":"Interested students must register for HISP 0750N .","1443":"Interested students must register for CLAS 1120G .","1444":"Interested students must register for HIST 1205 .","1445":"Interested students must register for HIST 1210A .","1446":"Interested students must register for HISP 1210E or FREN 1020B .","1447":"Interested students must register for RELS 1325C .","1448":"Interested students must register for JUDS 1630 .","1449":"Interested students must register for HIST 1963Q .","1450":"This course highlights major cultural, social, and political developments in the amorphous region known, since the 20th century, as the Middle East. Covering expanses of space and time, this course attends to a diversity of peoples and polities, and considers different regional concepts that include some or all of the territories normally included in the Middle East (including the Fertile Crescent, the Mediterranean world, the Indian Ocean world, the Arab world, and the Muslim world) and addresses the region's coherence in terms of shared historical and political experiences, religious and cultural references or practices, and\/or socialities and ways of being.","1451":"This seminar will engage current debates on heritage, traditions, and history in Israel-Palestine with a focus on shared as well as antagonistic cultural and artistic spheres. It will explore how contested narratives can produce diverse perspectives and positions with regard to past and current events. The focus will be on cultural productions in Israel-Palestine and on diasporic Israeli and Palestinian communities in Europe and the US. In addition, examples from the visual and performing arts, museums and public spaces, film and media will illustrate how cultural expressions and events can foster dialogue. Students will work individually and together to design and implement a public event for the Brown and larger Rhode Island community and beyond on the subject of Israel-Palestine, bridging the divides of the region’s diverse ethnic and religious populations through cultural dialogue.","1452":"This course offers an introduction to Iranian cinema, moving chronologically from 1960 to 2024. While offering a historical account of Iranian cinema, this course addresses questions related to aesthetics, genre, style, and criticism, as well as sociopolitical and cultural categories such as gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, body, marriage and family, religion, national identity, language, power, politics and war. Rather than focusing exclusively on arthouse cinema, this course will draw attention to the heterogeneous body of Iranian cinema, including popular genres, exilic and diasporic films, as well as experimental, documentary films and visual anthropology. Examining Iranian cinema’s cross-cultural references, its relation to cinemas of the region and to transnational and global aesthetics, this course critically examines the category of national cinema. No prior knowledge of Iranian cinema or Persian\/Farsi required (films will be screened with English subtitles).","1453":"Interested students must register for HIST 1968A .","1454":"This introductory course will explore its three key terms &quot;modern,&quot; &quot;culture,&quot; and &quot;media&quot; through a variety of theories, historical narratives, and media objects. We will ask how different media—such as print, photography, cinema, television, digital art, online video, archival practices, and social media—yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, and feeling, structure the ways we act and engage with the common world, and communicate and collaborate. We will read semiotic theory, critical race studies, feminist, post-colonial, queer and political theory, and examine concepts such as textuality, visuality, and networks. Open to undergraduates only.","1455":"This course introduces students to the crtiical study of digital media: from surveillance to hactivism, from cyberpunk fiction\/films to art installations, from social media to video games. We will analyze the aesthetics, politics, protocols, history and theory of digital media. Special attention will be paid to its impact on\/relation to social\/cultural formations, especially in terms of new media’s “wonderful creepiness,” that is, how it compromises the boundaries between the public and private, revolutionary and conventional, work and leisure, hype and reality.","1456":"Introduces students to rigorous study of the structural and ideological attributes of cinema, concentrating on the dominant narrative model developed in the American studio system and alternatives to that model. Attention to film theory in relation to questions of representation, culture, and society. Students become conversant with specific elements and operations of the cinematic apparatus (e. g. camerawork, editing, sound-image relations) and how they produce discursive meanings. Open to undergraduates only.","1457":"The course will provide students with a basic introduction to digital sound and image acquisition and post-production, and to consider the particular capabilities of these digital technologies, especially as these relate to the production of meaning. Of particular interest will be the representational limits of these technologies at the intersection of science and art. Classes will be organized as workshop environments where extensive class time will be devoted to hands-on learning with digital film cameras, lighting, and digital sound recorders. There are no prerequisites for this class.","1458":"Drawing on histories and subcultures of electronic dance music, alongside theories of sampling, mixing, remixing and postproduction, this practice-based course offers a basic introduction to DJ and production technologies as well as an exploration of world making tactics via the manipulation of sound and space. How do DJs manipulate sound to stitch together a unique sonic narrative? How is DJing itself a kind of theorizing through sound? Topics include the history of the DJ from the early 20th century to the rise of DJ-focused dance musics, from hip-hop to techno. Students will have hands-on experience with CDJs and throughout the semester, students will work on a series of short sound exercises and a final or collaborative project. There are no prerequisites for this class.","1459":"A studio-style course on working with time based media, focused specifically on the technology of 16mm film production. With its focus on photographic and montage processes, as well as lighting and sound, the principles established in this course provide a solid foundation for all subsequent work in media, whether cinematic, video or new media, and it is strongly advised as a foundation level, skills oriented media course. Students produce a series of short, non-sync films. No previous experience required. Screenings, demonstrations and studio work.","1460":"This course examines both commercial television and non-commercial media forms, considering the dialogue and\/or tensions between them. What are the critical potentials and political stakes of viewing TV and of making independent media? How can we re-write TV's cultural codes by stimulating alternative readings, fostering new interpretive practices, creating different texts, or developing diverse modes and sites of distribution? Combining theory and practice (media studies, televisual and anti-televisual screenings, and simple production assignments using available technologies), this course encourages students to read and critique commercial television through both analysis and their own creative media practices.","1461":"This studio\/seminar course explores and actively engages with digital media and experimental artistic practices that investigate the relationships between bodies, power, and technology. Focusing on questions of gender and sexuality, we will address topics such as queergaming and cyberfeminism, disembodied AI-chatbots and the datafication of the body, algorithmic socio-affective extraction and surrogate-digital labor, Black data and the deep-web, biopower and pharmaco-power. Through technical workshops (video\/coding\/live-media), theoretical explorations (critical theories of gender, disability, sexuality, and race as they intersect with contemporary art making), students will engage with a series of short creative assignments and develop a major project. This final project can manifest as a digital-media installation, AI-based artwork, sound piece, art film, multimedia performance, and more. This course emphasizes a non-competitive art pedagogical model, encouraging peer sharing of creative skills and tactics, along with ongoing work-in-progress presentations.","1462":"A production course that examines the role of sound in film, video, and installation forms. The listening assignments and visual media screenings will foreground the usage of audio in the works of selected artists\/filmmakers. The course also considers works of sound art. Readings by sonic theorists and producers will examine the possibilities of sound production as a key register of modern social and aesthetic experience. Class members should have completed at least one time-based media class. Students are expected to be competent technically.","1463":"Surveillance media surround us; we are watched by CCTV cameras and satellites and tracked by our cellphones and computers. In this course, we will examine surveillance media as technologies of power that do not neutrally perceive but actively produce subjects. This course focuses on government surveillance, looking at drones, border surveillance and war media, but extends to other sites such as the factory and workplace. Key threads here will be the origins of contemporary surveillance in capitalism, colonialism, and empire. Throughout the semester we will attend to how some are disproportionately targeted according to race, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability, religion, and citizenship. We will also ask what it means to resist surveillance, with particular attention to surveillance in contemporary visual culture. This entails asking what it means to look back and how not to be seen.","1464":"What does it mean to interpret and “diagnose”? How do we interpret and diagnose others, and how do we interpret and diagnose ourselves? What forms of self-discovery are enacted? And what forms of violence might take place instead? In this course, we will explore “diagnostics” and “diagnostic media” as a specific way media is used to build meaning about others and ourselves. This course will be shaped around two key facets of diagnostics: diagnostics as a media form, and diagnostics a mode of encounter. We will pay close attention to the ways empire, race, gender, sexuality, and ability are intertwined in these discussions, and how we create worlds about our experiences, and the experiences of others.","1465":"What is the relation between capital and the computer? To answer this question, this course attends to the particulars of the computer as a mathematical proposition, to its claim to legitimacy as a logic of superior military and political organization, and to its elaboration as something of a natural philosophy in scientific practice. In doing so, we will formulate a conceptual basis to critically assess the glittery promises of current discourse invoking Artificial Intelligence (A.I), which sees near-total automation as inevitable and the threat of sentient Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I) as nigh. We will establish a critique of the computer as a structure (as a philosophical arrangement with a specific and persistent imagination) to think critically about popular ideologies associated with A.I., often put forward by those with capital stake in its commercial success.","1466":"Interested students must register for ENGL 0101G .","1467":"Interested students must register for ENGL 0700V .","1468":"This fully immersive, intensive and project-oriented summer course introduces students to World Cinema and its histories through an original contextualized approach centered around the Cinema Ritrovato Film Festival, hosted every summer by the Cineteca of Bologna.","1469":"The killer, their victims, the ‘terrible place,’ the ‘final girl’: components like these, associated with 1970s American slasher films, tend to dominate popular accounts of the genre—but the cinema of fear and sensation is a dynamic mode of contemporary filmmaking, transnational in its origins and circulation, and thematically and formally eclectic. This course will study the horror genre through scholarly and critical debates, emphasizing the ways both experts and enthusiasts have theorized horror's significance and social urgency, the unique properties of horror spectatorship, and the formal attributes of individual films. Each week will focus on a specific conceptual area, including monstrosity, the uncanny, Otherness, excess, allegory, haunting, and abjection.","1470":"This course provides a systematic introduction to the forms, history, and culture of Japanese animation (anime). Surveying the historical developments, artistic styles, major themes and subgenres of anime under both the national context of Japan and a wider trajectory of globalization, this course focuses on analyzing the forms and idioms of anime in relation to changing technological conditions and their cultural ramifications. The students are expected to relate anime culture with their experience of new media technologies, and to expand their artistic interest in anime to wider theoretical questions such as posthumanism, globalism, techno-orientalism, and media convergence.","1471":"This course provides an introduction to the history of black popular music since the1970s, focusing primarily on sound cultures from the US, Caribbean, and Western Europe. We will begin by studying the mixing techniques developed in Reggae (dub), Disco (remix), and Hip-Hop (scratching and sampling) to discuss how they have shaped popular music since the1970s. We will then survey these genres as well as the histories of R&amp;B, House and Techno and some of their many offshoots (Jungle &amp; Afrobeats, for instance) have developed over the last 30 years to ask how popular music functions as one of the main channels of communication among the cultures of the African diaspora. Overall, this course investigates the aesthetic, political, cultural, and economic dimensions of black popular music, paying particular attention to questions of gender, sexuality, class, nation, language, and technology.","1472":"What do we want from a night out? What is possible in this “queer” time? And what are we wearing to the function? This seminar explores the connections between and among nightlife, queer worldmaking, and other unruly subcultural practices. Rather than a linear history of nightlife and club culture, in each week we venture to a new theme\/destination. We explore the spaces, the dancing, the outfits, the laws and legal gray areas, the drag, the cruising, and the rumbling bass, textures, and frequencies of queer nightlife. Through close readings, guest speakers, site visits and sustained cultural analysis, we acquire a critical understanding of the potentialities of queer &quot;after hours&quot; in the making of subcultural identity and emerging aesthetic practices. The course melds theory and practice and includes site visits to Providence area venues as well as a CDJ workshop.","1473":"What does it mean to think about art, place, history and meaning making in the Americas? What kinds of visualities, imaginaries, and memories guide how we imagine South America, Chile? What are the roles of art, video, performance, and memorials as sites of emplacing memory, collective witness, creating future possibilities? Our thinking, making, and engagement is guided by social, cultural, feminist, and environmental movements and explore modes of sensing, creating, feeling and being with the land through Indigenous, migrant, “expert” and local knowledge and place. How are these projects raced and gendered? What kinds of aesthetics and art projects inform our own understandings of emplaced learning? This course invites us to think with creators and place. It will support and guide you towards making and living with art as a way to perceive with and beyond neoliberal and colonial logics.","1474":"While the African diaspora is generally associated with the history of the Americas, recent years have seen the proliferation of African descended communities in Europe due to the aftermath of colonialism and various forms migration. This course will introduce students to the cultural productions of Afro-diasporic groups in Britain and Germany through film, literature, and music.","1475":"Aesthetic thought has a long and varied history, but aesthetic categories have recently become a central concern of cultural studies. This course combines readings in the history of aesthetics; twentieth-century work on aesthetics from various philosophical and disciplinary perspectives (from the &quot;anti-aesthetic&quot; to &quot;a return to aesthetics&quot;); and recent scholarship addressing (while not necessarily celebrating) the reemergence of aesthetic questions in cultural and media studies and the evolving relationship of the aesthetic to categories such as ideology, form, and virtuality. Readings from Schiller and Kant to Adorno, Berube, Foster, Ranciere, and Spivak.","1476":"Interested students must register for ENGL 1762D .","1477":"The films of Hitchcock often overwhelm the compelling narratives for which they are widely appreciated by threading them through meta-cinematic reflections on the nature of cinema itself. This peculiar method of construction has piqued the attention not only of film theorists, who look to Hitchcock to teach them about technique, but also philosophers, who look to him to help them thing more clearly about the nature of thinking, promising, doubting, and obsession. We will not only examine the films themselves alongside the speculations they have inspired, but also attempt to define the complex pleasures – somatic, cinematic, and cerebral –they elicit from viewers.","1478":"Our era has been called both &quot;post-televisual&quot; and &quot;post-racial,&quot; yet images that define and are defined by (mis)understandings of race fill our screens (whether on TV sets or other means for disseminating television). Formations of television and race not only remain pressing concerns but are intertwined, mutually constructing one another. This course explores how notions of race have been mediated and how media have figured race. Topics include: stereotype analysis (and beyond); televising Civil Rights; intersections of gender and sexuality; consumerism and commodification; crisis and scandal; racial representation across TV genres (comedy, drama, sports, reality TV), and new media possibilities.","1479":"Interested students must register for COLT 1440U .","1480":"Hyperpop: a meme, a subculture, a Spotify playlist, a mashup of disparate sounds, a sense of street style, a glitch, a microgenre and an anti-genre noted for its brashness, intensity, and maximalist take on pop. This senior seminar will provide an introduction to the study of contemporary popular culture through the lens of hyper\/pop as a queer and trans aesthetics of intensity, maximalism and excess. Readings, discussions and screenings will engage theories of gender, punk, fashion, the glitch, postmodernism, remixing and hacking, and students will engage with examples of hyper\/pop from music, contemporary art, fashion, film and television. Overall, this course investigates the aesthetics of a “hyper” popular culture, with a particular focus on queer and trans artists pushing the limits of form. Final projects will be production focused.","1481":"Beginning with examples of repetition, adaptation, or re-making in feminist, literary, or political theory, cinema studies and philosophy, legal studies and history, (eg., Butler, Cavell, Douglass, Morrison, Spillers) this seminar will study the re-do: looking at filmic remakes\/adaptations in political\/cultural contexts as iterative, citational, augmentative\/aspirational or perfectionist. The aim is to consider such efforts in connection with debates in the fields of Adaptation Studies, structuralism\/post structuralism, Classics' “reception studies.” The focus is on adaptation as a site of contestation. Is it conservative reclamation? or radical reform\/abolition of contemporary norms, genders, institutions, and politics? Final projects can be essays or performance pieces, adaptations or analyses. All will be shared collectively in the final class","1482":"An advanced seminar for students of video and\/or film production. Focuses on the critical discussion and production of documentary media. A major project (10-20 minutes), three shorter works, and in-class presentations of work-in-progress required. Readings on the theory and practice of the form and weekly screenings augment the presentation of student work. Class members should have completed at least one time-based media class. Students are expected to be competent technically.","1483":"What is extracted and accumulated, what is reduced and deterritorialized, what exceeds archival and algorithmic capture, what remains radically incomputable. This advanced studio\/seminar course will confront both the archive and AI dataset as technologies of power—hegemonic epistemological ordering\/extraction. While doing so, we will explore art’s potential to craft counter-narratives and generate new poetics of retrieving and preserving; of holding in common(s). Key topics include feminist shadow archives, queer-life and leaky archives, archives of feelings, speculative-critical fabulation, AI-generated mean-images, and ungovernable, incomputable data. Through video, digital media, and AI-hacking workshops, analysis of art case studies, and theoretical explorations, students will develop a major research-driven art project. This project can manifest as an AI-based artwork, sound piece, video, performance, curatorial intervention, writing, and more. The course includes a visit to the Providence Queer-Archive-Work and concludes with a final group speed-show.","1484":"Archives and archivists have been described as agents with the power to control, privilege, and marginalize collections and their histories. This power can be wielded to determine the shape and direction of historical scholarship, collective memory, and identities, thereby impacting how we know ourselves as individuals, groups, and societies. These links are further complicated in archives where the provenance of collections is unclear. Students will gain a greater understanding of archival organization and authority, and are encouraged to imagine new modes of access to archives forging their own openings into\/beyond the archives: making material traces and connections to produce critically engaged, creative works. Projects may take many forms: historiography; speculative, revisionist, or historical fictions; live or recorded performances; site-specific installations; single or multi-channel AV works, or curated programs.","1485":"We will focus on the long and subtle debate Georges Canguilhem -- the famous historian of biological sciences and student of Bachelard-- conducted with Bergson. While known to many through Foucault's extraordinary praise for him, Canguilhem contributed less to the topic of social norms than to the question of the (in)curability of the psyche. &quot;What is Psychology?&quot; &quot;The Concept of Life,&quot; &quot;The Living and its Milieu&quot; among other celebrated essays are virtually unreadable outside a psychoanalytic context.","1486":"This course will engage with possibilities and problems of queer theorizing, from the emergence of queer theory, through its (precarious) institutionalization, to its multiplied interventions. Rather than understanding queer theory as a unified approach, we will consider a range of queer theoretical work as well as challenges within queer analysis itself. Issues to be explored include formations of gender and sexuality, race and nation, epistemology and ethics, politics and communities, subjectivities and socialities, identifications and disidentifications, bodies and pleasures, publics and privates, and the temporalities and locations of our world. Preference given to graduate students; all others seek instructor permission.","1487":"Contemporary discussions of the problem of form and of reading practices have often proceeded on separate tracks. The question “what is it to read?” animates topics such as close and distant reading; ideology and hermeneutics of suspicion; figures of affect, surface, and repair. Inquiries into form highlight defamiliarization and (a)historicism; plasticity and formlessness; aesthetics and heteroglossia; dissensus and engagement. Articulating questions of form with questions reading refocuses our attention on the work of form: form as process, as productive, as reformation. Our course will approach the issues of subjectivity and theoretical objects, ideology and pleasure, new formalisms and the politics of the aesthetic in theoretical work from the twentieth and twentieth century across the disciplines. We will focus both on thinking about “reading for form” and on cognate terms for reader, spectator, user, gamer, reconfiguring our theories of form.","1488":"This class explores mediatic modes of citation, recursion, gesture, im\/possibility, redaction, and nonrepresentational mimesis. We will inquire after Rizvana Bradley’s idea of &quot;anteaesthetics&quot; in works such as Jaffa's appositional response to Snow's Wavelength; Lemon's nesting of Tarkovksy's Solaris within Ceremonies of the Air; Hopinka's Lore beside Frampton's Nostalgia; Cassils' recursive Haroki; Sansour's recursive Kubrik; Shonibare's redactive Verdi; and Ligon’s Hands in response to Farrakhan's Million Man March. Works that gesture (often obliquely or opaquely) by Belmore, Perry, Morimura, Leigh, Brand, Bey will participate. The title replays Irigaray's &quot;Commodities Among Themselves&quot; to ask after fungibility in the ongoing colonial-capitalism of the Plantationocene.","1489":"Interested students must register for ITAL 2190I .","1490":"Interested students must register for TAPS 2100 .","1491":"Anthropocenic exhaustion begs for new\/old artistic modes of gathering and collectivity. How can we think, do, create, perform, listen, sense, perceive, and generate future-oriented imaginaries based on the texture of ancient ways? This collaborative humanities course centers perspectives, translations, and mediations from and about the Américas. We seek to decenter the liberal humanism of environmental thinking to present modes of being that emerge from the otherwise of the Américas. This imaginary is pluralistic in its linguistic, racial, ethnic, and gendered imagination. It foregrounds submerged perspectives and unearths subterranean stories that confront legacies of (neo)colonialism, racial capitalism, and extractivist exploitation. Guest participants — with the support of the Brown Arts and Cogut Institutes, Modern Culture and Media, and Portuguese and Brazilian Studies — enliven our study across the U.S., Turtle Island, and Abya Yala (the Indigenous nomenclature for the Américas).","1492":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","1493":"Designed for students with little or no prior knowledge of Modern Greek. The aim is to introduce students to basic linguistic structures and develop the ability to comprehend and produce text, as well as to speak and understand speech, in a variety of contexts and registers. The course objectives are to enable students to perform a range of tasks, master a minimum core vocabulary and acquire knowledge and understanding of various forms of Greek culture.","1494":"Develops linguistic and cultural competence and may be taken by anyone who has completed MGRK 0200 or after consultation with the instructor and\/or a placement exam. It focuses on further development of the four language skills as well as knowledge and understanding of various aspects of Greek society. It employs a variety of materials, including film, digital stories, internet based sources, music, art, and literature.","1495":"May be taken by students who have completed the previous sequences or by anyone who places successfully into the course. The course places emphasis on the improvement of writing and oral skills, via presentations, collaborative projects, conversations and assignments based on topics and texts, drawn from a variety of sources and cultural forms of expression.","1496":"In the past few years, we have all experienced, most of us through the media, what has been called a migration crisis. And yet, migration as a phenomenon did not appear in 2015; it is as old as humanity, and displacement and contemporary forced migration have also a long history. In this course, we will examine the historical, material and experiential dimensions of contemporary displacement and migration. Many of the examples will be from Greece but also other parts of Mediterranean and beyond, including from the Mexico-US border. Engaged Scholarship Course.","1497":"This is an advanced undergraduate seminar that will offer students the opportunity to build on their linguistic, cultural and critical literacies, by translating from Greek into English. Over the course of the semester we will be thinking critically about texts, their ideological, historical and social coordinates and their embedded discourses of Greekness, community, diglossia, identity and gender, among others. In addition to translating from Greek into English, we will read and discuss essays on translation, in order to consider in an informed way the issues (untranslatability?) and types of decision making associated with the practice of translation.","1498":"This seminar considers the theater shows of Stephen Sondheim in relation to the history of the American musical. Through close study of selected scenes and shows, we examine how and why Sondheim and his collaborators “reinvented” the genre. Special emphasis will be given to Sondheim's critical skepticism concerning the myths, characters, and ethos of social optimism that have been central to the Broadway tradition. We examine links between the shows and post-WWII historical contexts, and consider the political implications of the circumscribed social universe—predominantly white, urban, and affluent—within which most of his shows take place.","1499":"This course uses the organizing figure of play to explore several forms of human activity, and to consider the relationship between them. Building on existing scholarly approaches to the role of play in human flourishing, it asks how play structures music, sports, and game in ways that are comparable, how the different modalities of each activity give rise to unique principles of play and competition, and how these three domains interact with one another. Topics will include musical improvisation and competition, in forums ranging from rap battles to air guitar; the role of sound in professional sports marketing and in-game experience design; the songs that enliven children’s games and the soundtracks of video games; forms such as capoeira, which involve playful interaction in several different domains; and many more.","1500":"Explores jazz in relation to American history, discussing how economics, war conditionsm regional differences and race relations shaped the music an its public reception. With readings from A. Baraka, L. Levine, R. Ellison, L. Erenberg, E. Lott, G. Early, S. DeVeaux and others, we address how jazz embodies social and political values or expresses national character. Open to non-musicians. Music proficiency preferred but not required. Enrollment limited to 60.","1501":"Computers and Music examines the production, history and theory of music technology. The course tracks the development of musical inventions and their impact on musical thought and culture. Students completing Music 200 will gain a practical knowledge of electronic music based on first-hand experience with music production software to complete several creative assignments. Students will also gain an appreciation for the pioneering work done in previous decades in research, songwriting and performance. Finally, students will become familiar with the literature of electronic music and learn about the impact of technology on popular and experimental genres. The course combines synchronous online lectures with in-person lab sections. No special knowledge of music or technology is expected. Priority given to lower-level students and music concentrators. Upper-level students will be admitted as space allows, by permission of instructor.","1502":"The collaborative approach to sound creation often yields new possibilities, ideas, and perspectives on sound that can be later utilized in the creation of new music projects. In this course, students will have the opportunity to explore different types of improvisation in collaborative studio sessions, create their own music projects, and learn about existing &quot;open score&quot; repertoire. Students may engage in projects that also include video, audio recording, and, if it's of interest - theater and choreographic elements. The course will culminate in a public premiere performance of the newly created works.","1503":"An introduction to musical terms, elements, and techniques.

The range of answers gave birth to a musical style that looked backwards into the Baroque for textural density and flow, abandoning the articulated symmetry of the classical phrase, while pushing the harmonic language, musical drama, and effect into new horizons. All the while, the search for alternative structures and points of musical departure, resulted in a new sort of interaction between music and other art forms. Schumann’s E.T.A Hoffman’s inspired character pieces, Berlioz’s program music, the proliferation of the Lied, Liszt’s Dante Sonata and Petrarca sonnets are telling examples of this search for a new musical style and context.","1519":"Western Music 1000-1700 Topics addressed - among many others!

Through a broad selection of sources translated into English, students will familiarize themselves with recent historical events in Iran and become more acquainted with various aspects of Iranian culture. The chronological focus will be from the 1979 Iranian Revolution to the present and will be organized around a number of social and political themes, including corruption, authoritarianism, multiculturalism, race, social class, religion and gender relations. No proficiency in Persian (Farsi) is required to enroll; however a separate discussion will be offered for students with Persian proficiency. No prior knowledge of the Middle East needed to enroll.","1584":"We’ll concentrate on some fundamental moral and metaphysical issues concerning ourselves as persons: What (if anything) gives us a moral status different from that of other animals? Do we have the sort of free will required for us to be morally responsible for our actions? What makes you one individual person or self at a particular time? What makes you today the same individual person as that obnoxious 5-year old who went by your name a few years back?","1585":"How does a sage live their life? What do we have to do to become sages? Chinese philosophers throughout history have answers to these questions. In this course, we investigate the ethics of (ancient) Chinese sagehood and how they relate to a good and moral life, with a special focus on different variations of Confucianism and Daoism. We will start with Confucius, Mencius, and Zhuangzi in the Warring States, to Laozi in the Western Zhou Dynasty, and end with Wang Yang Ming in the Ming Dynasty. Crucially, the course involves an experimental element: students will be asked to not only think about sagehood, but also experiment with living like a sage. We will thus be experimenting with several meditation methods, reflection methods, and discussion methods. This course will also involve a field trip to an art museum.","1586":"Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have already begun to reshape our world, raising a host of new practical and theoretical challenges. Do Large Language Models generate and understand text as humans do? Or might contemporary AI present a new and radically alien form of intelligence? Could artificial systems ever become conscious? And how might we foresee and forestall potential negative impacts of AI, including the spread of misinformation and the replication of human biases in artificial systems? In this course, we will exploring these and related philosophical questions as we trace the rise of artificial intelligence from the days of Alan Turing to today’s cutting edge deep neural networks.","1587":"Capitalism is the world’s dominant economic system. Billions live under it; arguably, the majority of us do, and even those who do not are affected by it. Yet many wish we did not. Historically, the greatest opposition has come from those who have described themselves as socialists. While socialism underwent a loss of popularity in the latter part of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st due to the failures of self-described socialist regimes, it appears to be regaining popularity, at least among younger generations. But which is in fact better: capitalism or socialism? The question can still provoke heated debate. In this course, we will explore the ethical arguments for and against these economic systems, as well as ethical questions that each system raises. The goal will be to equip you to compare the systems.","1588":"Do you like to read short stories and discuss the ethical issues they raise? In this seminar, we will discuss contemporary American short stories in terms of ethical issues involving love, envy, kindness, cruelty, pride, pity, grief, obligation, charity, and other areas. How can such discussions offer fresh perspectives on ﬁction as well as on ethics? This is an in-person seminar with all sessions available for remote participation by students who have valid reasons for not being able to attend in person. In addition, all sessions will be recorded.","1589":"This course will deal with questions about the epistemology, metaphysics, aesthetics, ethics and politics of food: how we should reason about the things we eat, what makes them tasty or artistic, and what we ought and ought not to eat and how we ought to structure the environment in which food is produced and distributed. This seminar is meant as a general introduction to philosophy, in which you will familiarize yourself with long-standing kinds of philosophical questions and modes of reasoning. Food will be our anchor topic, the subject matter that gives us the occasion for such philosophical reflection.","1590":"In this class, we will investigate health, disability, and illness—and the roles they play in our philosophical theories in our lives. Topics include the nature of health, illness, and disability; normative questions about their value and their relationship to well-being; and epistemological questions about the sources of evidence we can and ought to use to think about these issues, including personal experience and testimony. The course will also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking more generally: an opportunity to begin to develop philosophical skills, in connection with topics that we care about deeply. This is a first-year seminar (FYS), and so enrollment is restricted to first-year students. It is a conversation-based seminar, in which students will learn to work together in philosophical inquiry.","1591":"Critical reasoning is the art of recognizing, analyzing, composing and evaluating arguments. In this course, students will acquire skills that are needed not only to understand and evaluate complex arguments, but also to construct strong arguments themselves. Together we will cover topics such as: validity and soundness, argument decomposition and construction, deductive and inductive arguments, and fallacious reasoning. After solidifying their critical reasoning skills, students will apply those skills to a number of challenging philosophical debates, touching on themes such as free will, skepticism, and morality.","1592":"This course will introduce students to the major concerns of Greek philosophy, and how they are addressed by the Presocratics, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. We will have two related ends: historical and critical. On the one hand, we will get clear so far as we are able what it is that these thinkers thought; on the other, it is important to evaluate their arguments. This course will emphasize the identification of the problems and the solutions to them that seemed pressing to these thinkers, especially if such problems seem alien to us.","1593":"Are we morally obligated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Do we have moral obligations toward nature, animals and other people, for instance future generations and refugees? Is abortion morally wrong? Is legalization of drugs the right thing to do? In this course we will explore these and other contemporary ethical issues in the context of important moral theories; utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and the social contract theory. This course will serve as an introduction to applied ethics and normative ethics.","1594":"An introduction to central themes in Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. Major topics include: reason, experience, and knowledge; substance and the nature of the world as it really is; induction, causation, and the origin of our ideas; skepticism, realism, and idealism. Connections are made with the scientific revolution of the 17th century. There will be discussion and advice on ways to approach philosophical reading, research and writing.","1595":"This course is an introduction to deductive logic. The course is intended for students who have not taken a logic course before. The course starts with sentential logic, then moves on to natural deduction, quantifiers and predication, and truth trees. The course will include some related topics: vagueness, conditionals or counterfactuals.","1596":"This course is an introduction to classic texts of 19th century German philosophy. Readings include key texts by Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. The course explores the German idealist response to Kant as well as Marx’s and Nietzsche’s challenges to the project of philosophy and traditional conceptions of reason, morality, and agency.","1597":"This interdisciplinary course provides an overview of some of the core conceptual tools used to analyze issues at the intersection of philosophy, politics, and economics (PPE). A range of theoretical topics are covered, including: game theory, property, markets, distributive justice, public choice theory, voting, and more. We will read classical and contemporary sources on these topics as well as explore their applications to contemporary social problems (including: climate change, healthcare rationing, price gouging, universal basic income, pharmaceutical regulations, and others).","1598":"An analytic investigation of some central problems and topics in political philosophy, including political obligation and civil disobedience, liberty, rights, equality, and democracy. Readings are drawn from recent work in the field, along with a few classics.","1599":"An introduction to perhaps the most fundamental tool of rational thought: deductive logic. Course begins with basic sentential logic, then moves on to deduction, quantification, and predication. Argumentation and reasoning may also be addressed at times. No previous experience with logic or philosophy is required.","1600":"This is an undergraduate seminar on the philosophy of perception intended primarily for junior and senior concentrators. Topics include: naive realist versus representational theories of sensory experience, the possibility that sensory experience is massively illusory (so that we already occupy a kind of “virtual reality”), the role of the brain in shaping sensory experience, and the alleged foundational role of sensory experience in knowledge. The focus will be on vision but we will also discuss other sense-modalities. Prerequisite: at least 2 previous courses in philosophy.","1601":"We'll study some &quot;hot topics&quot; in epistemology. Some possible questions: (1) What's the relationship between rational belief and logic? (2) Is belief best thought as all-or-nothing, as coming in gradations, or both? (3) Can the same evidence support divergent belief-states? (4) Is rational belief completely determined by evidence, or also by values or practical interests? (5) Are graded beliefs best seen as coming in precise degrees, or as more &quot;spread-out&quot;? (6) Can I have rational beliefs I know are denied by others just as intelligent, unbiased, well-informed, etc., as I am? Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.","1602":"What is it to be rational? This course takes up that question by looking at a number of intriguing puzzles. For example: Is it irrational to not believe in God? Is it irrational to settle for less now when you could have more later? Is it irrational to intend to do something that you don't believe you'll do? Can it be rational to do what you hope you won't? When is it rational to be random? Is it ever rational to be irrational? Along the way, we will learn bayesian probability theory, decision theory, game theory, and social choice theory.","1603":"A central concern in legitimizing our criminal justice system is the justification of punishment. Given the objectionable nature of the intentional imposition of harm, a failure to adequately justify the practice can call into question its persistence. For democratic societies in particular, the question of whether punishment can be adequately justified is of special concern. This course will survey the major philosophical justifications for legal punishment. Special focus will be placed on the expressive dimensions of punishment, the punishment of adolescent offenders and the possibility of their incarceration with adults, as well as arguments for and against the abolition of incarceration as a form of punishment.","1604":"Climate change challenges our way of life and our institutions. The impact of climate change is not the same all over the globe. Developing countries may suffer worse consequences than wealthier countries. At the same time wealthier countries are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions. Maybe we can mitigate or adapt to climate change, but the question whether we should do something about climate change is an ethical question. The ethical question is complex. Who is morally responsible for climate change? Individuals? States and nations? Can past generations be held responsible for their greenhouse gas emissions? Do we have moral obligations toward future generations? Should all countries bear the burden of climate change equally?","1605":"A close study of Aristotle’s Metaphysics, which he called First Philosophy and contrasts with the natural sciences, and culminates in his theology. We shall also read and discuss some supplementary texts of Aristotle and contemporary secondary material. All readings in translation. The class will combine lectures and discussion.","1606":"The philosophers we’ll read in this course have a lot of advice for us. Epicurus recommends that we “[g]et used to believing that death is nothing to us” (Letter to Menoeceus, trans. Inwood and Gerson). Epictetus tells us: “Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well” (Handbook 8, trans. White). Lucretius describes at length the “ills” that are “experienced in love that is steadfast and supremely successful”—and adds that “when love is frustrated and unrequited, the miseries you can spot with your eyes shut are countless” (On the Nature of Things 4, trans. Ferguson Smith). What are we to make of all this advice? And what’s behind it?","1607":"The course will focus on the principle of sufficient reason and involve a close reading of Spinoza's Ethics, along with other texts from Leibniz, Schopenhauer, Heidegger, and some contemporary writers.","1608":"Locke, Boyle and Margaret Cavendish. A detailed study both historical and critical. Topics include a selection from: innate ideas; substance; personal identity; language, classification; chemistry, 'corpuscles', and the nature of matter; challenges and hopes for natural philosophy; perception, skepticism","1609":"An introduction to the central themes of Kant's moral philosophy, including autonomy, freedom, happiness, obligation, and virtue. Kant's position in the history of moral philosophy will also be considered. Readings to include all of Kant's major writings in this field, thus Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason, Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, and Metaphysics of Morals, as well as several essays and lectures. Work will include two short papers and one term paper.","1610":"A systematic examination of the main alternative normative moral theories: consequentialism; moral rights; moral duties; moral virtues. Focuses on the principal issues in the formulation of the different theories, on the main points of conflict between them, and on the critical evaluation of each. Readings are drawn mainly from contemporary work in moral philosophy.","1611":"Investigates major theories and issues concerning the nature of moral value. Readings from 20th-century authors. Issues include naturalism, supervenience, moral motivation, subjectivity\/objectivity of value, skepticism, moral relativism, and moral realism.","1612":"Do you like to read and discuss fiction? Are you interested in discussing ethical issues in education? You can combine these things in this course, whose readings include fiction and poetry as well as philosophy and social science. Topics include: What are appropriate aims and methods for different types of education? What are appropriate student-teacher relationships? How should selective schools select students? How much, if at all, should schools concern themselves with students’ and teachers’ non-academic lives? How should schools deal with politically charged topics like race and gender and with current controversies? How have the Covid pandemic and its aftermath affected education? What special issues are involved in online teaching? In order to include participants with varied backgrounds, this course has no prerequisites.","1613":"Self-quantification is ubiquitous. From smart watches that track biometrics and sleep quality to productivity trackers which tell us how we actually spend our time, modern digital technologies provide us with the tools to observe, measure and collect data about ourselves at great levels of detail. But does this data really help us understand ourselves better? Is the kind of knowledge those technologies offer worth having? Does a quantified self lead to a happier self? In this course, we will explore self-quantification through a range of philosophical perspectives and debates from ethics and political philosophy to epistemology.","1614":"In this course, we map out and examine the various dimensions of the domain of prudential value, or what pertains to well-being. We begin with important features of the concept of prudential value itself, such as subject-relativity, the experience requirement, and the categories of prudential value (e.g., subjectivist and objectivist). We examine classic theories of well-being: hedonistic, desire, and eudaimonistic theories, as well as new theoretical options (internalist and constitutivist theories). Then we consider different varieties of prudential goods, including happiness, meaningfulness, achievement. Finally, we look at questions of the proper scope of prudential value, in particular whether it is best understood as a property of a whole life.","1615":"This seminar uses fiction as well as conventional bioethical material as a vehicle for philosophical discussions of disability, illness, and death. Topics include the following: What is disability? What is illness? What do healthy and able-bodied people owe sick, disabled, or dying people, and vice versa? Should we “accept” death, stave it off, or does this depend (on what)? How can fiction enrich philosophical discussions of such questions? In order to include students with a wide range of interests and backgrounds, this seminar has no prerequisites. It is an in-person seminar with all sessions available for remote participation by students who have valid reasons for not being able to attend in person, although the two weeks on quadriplegia will be fully remote to familiarize you with the educational feature of such classes, including their advantages for many disabled people.","1616":"An examination of various philosophical issues arising in the foundations of logic, such as the following: existence, definite description, reference and truth, semantic paradoxes, implication and presupposition, modalities and &quot;possible worlds,&quot; logical truth, the nature of logical knowledge, and logic in natural language.","1617":"A survey of some major topics in metaphysics, with a particular focus on radical metaphysical arguments – arguments that call into question our most basic beliefs about the world. Topics covered may include: What is personal identity? Does personal identity matter? Do personal identity and consciousness matter? Is there right and wrong and objective value? Is there free will? Are there any good arguments for God? Prerequisite: at least one course in philosophy (2 or more preferred).","1618":"Questions concerning the nature of mentality and its relation to the body. Selections from the following topics: mind and behavior, mind as the brain, mind as a computing machine, thought and language, action and mental causation, intentionality and consciousness. Prerequisite: at least one course in philosophy (2 or more preferred).","1619":"An examination of philosophical issues informed by elementary quantum mechanics; topics include the measurement problem, superposition, non-locality, and competing &quot;interpretations&quot; of the textbook formalism.","1620":"How is language used both to express and to communicate our beliefs and other thoughts? What is the relation between the meaning of a sentence and the meanings of the words that comprise it? We will discuss philosophical work on these and related questions including, potentially: the meanings of metaphors; the way meaning depends upon context; the nature of slurs and hate speech.","1621":"Will cover classics of philosophy from the end of the 19th century to the end of the 20th; including ethics as well as metaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of language.","1622":"No description available.","1623":"Course for graduate students during their 4th year or above.","1624":"Intentionality is a property possessed by mental entities that are about, directed on, or represent things other than themselves. Beliefs and concepts are paradigm cases of intentional entities. The goals of the course are, first, to inquire into the metaphysical nature of beliefs and concepts, second, to examine what it means for beliefs and concepts to be about or represent objects, properties, and facts, and third, to explore the relationships between beliefs and concepts and linguistic meanings.","1625":"This seminar will focus on Plato’s Philebus: his investigation of pleasure, knowledge, and the good life. The Philebus is an ethical dialogue, which also explores method, metaphysics, cosmology, and epistemology, with fascinating treatments of sound and color. We aim to discuss the dialogue in detail and to consider relevant passages in other dialogues, such as perception and judgment in the Theaetetus, falsehood in the Sophist, two arts of measurement in the Statesman, the Good in the Republic, and perception and perceptible qualities in the Timaeus. Our questions include: what method is advocated in the Philebus and how does it relate to similar methods in the Phaedrus, Sophist, and Statesman? Plato’s Socrates plays with the notions of limit, unlimited, mixture, and cause. How do those notions contribute to his investigation of pleasure, knowledge, and the good life?","1626":"This seminar focuses focus on recent literature about the nature of rationality. Questions to be discussed include: Why should we be rational (and what does that question even mean)? Can desires or emotions count as rational or irrational? Which mental states can count as rational and why? Is there a unified account of rationality across mental states? What is the relationship between &quot;substantive rationality&quot; and &quot;structural rationality&quot;?","1627":"Roderick Chisholm was one of the most important American philosophers during the second half of the 20th century. This seminar is organized around the work of Chisholm, but it is not just about him. Chisholm had distinctive positions on most of the major topics in epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind, positions that were subsequently built upon or challenged by others. Tracing his views and the responses to them can thus serve as something of a history of metaphysics and epistemology over a 50-year period, leading up to contemporary debates and providing background for them. My plan is to pair the reading by Chisholm each week with one or more readings by other philosophers who subsequently expounded his work, built on it, criticized it, or set forth competing positions.","1628":"Historical and contemporary topics in metaethical Expressivism, including: Geach’s Problem; Truth Minimalism; Reasoning and Error with normative belief; Negation and Disagreement; Threats of collapse; Hybrid Expressivist theories; metametaethics and the Problem of Creeping Minimalism.","1629":"The task of the philosophy of action was once described as telling the difference between a person’s arm rising and a person raising his arm. Agency is the property of being a creature who acts. This course is an exploration of agency. Questions to be discussed: What is the difference between things we do and things that happen to our bodies or our minds? Is there something special about humans acting as opposed to, say, cats who do things? What does it mean to act rationally and respond to reasons? Do we really decide which desire to act on, or does the strongest one always win? What happens in cases of drug addiction and other mental disorders? Can you intend to do something you don't know you'll do? Where does moral responsibility come in? How can you deceive yourself?","1630":"Many believe that the U.S. was wrong to invade Iraq in 2003. Can the country itself be guilty of a wrong, or is that just loose talk meant to summarize the wrongdoing of a bunch of individual Americans? More generally, it is common to think of some groups of people, as distinct from the individuals themselves, as believing, wanting, intending, or deciding certain things, and the group itself as being permitted, forbidden from doing certain things, or responsible or to blame for some of the its actions. A related idea is so-called structural injustice (e.g., structural racism or sexism) in which a society is wrongful in its structures and institutions in some way irrespective any wrongful individual members. In this seminar we will study the difficult philosophical problems each of these ideas raises.","1631":"For graduate students who have met the tuition requirement and are paying the registration fee to continue active enrollment while preparing for a preliminary examination.","1632":"For graduate students who have met the residency requirement and are continuing research on a full time basis.","1633":null,"1634":"Survey of mechanics for concentrators in sciences other than physics-including premedical and life science students.

Although much of the focus is on the contemporary United States and Latin America, the coverage is broadly historical, comparative, and global. The main drugs focused on are cocaine, opium, and cannabis, but will include alcohol, tobacco, and synthetics. The course also evaluates policy alternatives and the obstacles to policy reform. The course draws on readings from fields such as political science, anthropology, criminology, and history. The seminar is reading intensive, and is designed to cultivate critical writing and presentation skills. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.","1690":"Why do civil wars begin and end? Which people join rebellions? Why do states and non-state groups hurt civilians? What are the differences between rebel groups, terrorist organizations, and organized criminal groups? The seminar-based class aims introduce students to theories about and cases of political violence. It primarily draws on research in Political Science, though it also includes work from Economics, History, and Philosophy.","1691":"Americans today live in a time of deep political polarization, cultural tribalism, and self- segregation. Those with whom we have deep disagreements, assuming we interact with them at all, are often viewed as not just wrong but as irrational, immoral, or even contemptible. What are the causes and costs of these trends? What remedies might exist? Are there habits of mind that we might cultivate to build better citizens and a healthier democracy? This course develops and applies these habits of mind through conversations on a series of political topics. As a first-year seminar with discussion, this course will provide students with the tools of critical thinking and civil discourse that allow scholarly engagement and intellectual growth at Brown and beyond.","1692":"There's a common saying that &quot;money makes the world go round,&quot; but few people truly understand how money works. In this course you'll explore the politics of money, investigating topics such as financial crises, the role of the central banks in managing money, and the rise of cryptocurrency. You'll also learn how to write about money and politics for different audiences, everyone from scholars and policymakers to everyday people who lack basic financial expertise.

Together we will develop a shared base of knowledge to debate the critical questions that continue to shape world politics.","1693":"“The Black Vote” as a concept, simultaneously captures a truth and distortion. It reflects the truth that no other racial group comes close to the uniformity of Black Americans’ voting behavior within American electoral politics. Yet, this truth distorts or obscures the diversity of political opinions and ideological dispositions that animate a dynamic black American public. This course examines “the Black vote” through analyzing the historical context of its emergence and the host of contemporary democratic dilemmas that surround its persistence.","1694":"This course grapples with the problem of slavery and its connection to the political and psychological logic of white supremacy. Students will critically interrogate America’s attempt to grapple with black pain and white guilt. The course will also explore and critically evaluate the various responses African Americans have offered in their quest to realize freedom. We will see that African American political thought is not exclusively a response to social and political domination, but also contains a rich philosophical vision of human fulfillment, self-governance, and the good life. NO PREREQUISITES REQUIRED.","1695":"Examines the relationship between human beings and the earth as it has been conceived in the tradition of Western political thought from the ancient Greeks to the present day.

The second part of the course investigates environmental political theory at the cutting edge today, engaging a wide range of perspectives and methods in the field.","1696":"This course is about the &quot;underside&quot; of globalization. It introduces key sectors of the illicit global economy, including the clandestine flow of drugs, arms, people, body parts, arts and antiquities, endangered species, and toxic waste. The course compares these illicit sectors across time and place, and evaluates the practice and politics of state regulatory efforts. Particular attention is given to the role of the U.S. in the illicit global economy.","1697":"In this lecture course, we will explore the reasons that civic and political participation are important for democracy and self-determination as well as the multiple possible pathways - many of which are beyond the ballot box - for engaging in participation. We will also examine who participates, who’s participation is impeded and why, as well as what social structures are, what barriers to participation exist, how such barriers can be understood as systematic, and what happens in democracies when people are denied the opportunity to participate or – for a variety of reasons –refuse to participate.","1698":"The Founders established the U.S. Congress in Article I of the Constitution. It created that body as guardian of the nation’s purse strings and empowered it to &quot;make all laws necessary and proper.&quot; Will examine the Congress's structure, rules and procedures, traditions, precedents, campaigns, elections, parties, budget process, Member's constituencies and role in the system of checks and balances with the president and the courts.

The course will consistently relate the characteristics and history of the presidency to current events.","1701":"Public opinion is an essential component of democracy. Considering the lack of familiarity about current events, how does public opinion affect public policy? Perhaps more importantly, should it? To assess these questions, we will explore how to measure public opinion and what polls tell us. We will then assess the roots of public opinion and analyze the public policy and representational impact of people's preferences.","1702":"Focuses on political and economic transformation in contemporary Latin America. Special attention is given to the processes of market-oriented economic reforms and democratization that have swept the region during the last twenty-five years. Includes in-depth country case studies where key themes can be discussed and elaborated.","1703":"This course will concentrate on three aspects of the &quot;Indian experience&quot;: democracy, ethnic and religious diversity, and political economy. With a brief exception, India has continued to be democratic since 1947. No developing country matches India's democratic record. Second, remarkable cultural, ethnic and religious diversity marks India's social landscape, and influences its politics. Third, Indian economy has of late been going through a serious economic transformation, drawing comparisons with China. Is the comparison valid?","1704":"Will examine efforts to create significant policy change in contemporary political and social life in United States. We examine strategies of social change; explore the characteristics of advocacy organizations; and consider how organizations can expand their political toolkits as they seek to create social change. In addition, we will examine the relationship between organizations, members, and activists. Why do so many organizations lack active members? What does it take to turn members into activists? Among the cases we examine are the Civil Rights Movement, the Tea Party, Alinsky organizations, Black Lives Matter, the Koch Brothers Network, Dreamers, and organized labor.","1705":"The People's Republic of China is one of the most important actors in international politics today. This undergraduate lecture examines China's role in global affairs. It applies broad theoretical perspectives on international relations to understand China's choices across a broad range of foreign policy topic. What explains why China has increased its defense spending? When is it more likely to resort to military force? What explains patterns in China's trade and investment abroad? What accounts for China’s changing approach to climate change? To what extent does China seek to reshape the international order and what would this mean for the prospects for global peace and stability?","1706":"Examines the institutions and the processes by which states and other actors seek to provide \"governance\" in the international system. The class explores the history of, and various theoretical perspectives on, the role of the UN and other international organizations in the state system. It also considers their roles in a range of political, military, economic, environmental, and humanitarian issues.

Class analyzes the shift from the classical liberal Gold Standard through the Post-War Bretton Woods arrangements through to the globalized IPE of today.","1708":"This course introduces students to the study of contemporary African politics. The questions that motivate the course are: How did authoritarian regimes arise in most countries after African independence? Why have some African countries become democratic, while others have remained authoritarian? What accounts for patterns of conflict and civil war across countries? Throughout the semester, we will see that there is significant variation within Africa in the strength of states, levels of economic growth, and respect for democratic institutions; we will aim to explain these variations. We will primarily study events in particular African countries, but will also examine broad patterns across countries and use social science concepts and methods to try to explain them. In our exploration, we will mostly build on the work of political scientists but also draw heavily on work by journalists, psychologists, economists, and historians.","1709":"This class uses theories and tools from the social sciences to understand criminal behavior in a variety of settings. It examines whether we can use rational choice theories to explain patterns of offending and the organization and operation of illicit markets. We will investigate the different way that governments seek to control crime, as well as, non-state alternatives to public safety. Organized crime groups have significant influence in communities both historically and today, so we study why they exist and how they organize. Finally, we look at how political institutions affect crime and the operation of the criminal legal system, including persistent problems of racial disparities at all points in the system.","1710":"An introduction to the politics of international economic relations. Examines the history of international political economy and theoretical approaches to understanding it. Also analyzes several key contemporary issues in international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization, globalization and its consequences, and challenges in foreign economic policy-making.","1711":"This course explores the history of feminist political thought. It provides an overview of the dominant approaches to feminist theory, and to the emergence and development of feminist movements in the U.S. and elsewhere. We will pay particular attention to the way intersectional feminist thinkers have challenged the centrality of gender in feminist analysis, and will assess the future of feminist praxis and theorizing. The course is organized around significant themes and debates within feminist theory, including but not limited to: early feminist approaches (such as liberal, Marxist, radical, and standpoint feminism); the theoretical implications of critiques of early feminist theory by black, indigenous and other intersectional feminists; and contemporary feminist formations such as trans and abolition feminisms.","1712":"This course provides an examination of the intersection between political ends and military means.

This course examines the roles of race and gender in American politics with a particular emphasis on women of color. The course focuses in social movements, political participation, and political representation. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.","1724":"Will tackle the “hard problems” governments sometimes have to deal with. For example, while governments are often cajoled and enjoined to produce economic growth, especially during recessions, do something about economic inequality and social mobility, and improve the life chances of millions through purposive action, actually delivering these things is incredibly hard. These areas constitute ‘“hard problems” for two main reasons. Economically, we don’t really have much of a clue about how to do many of these things. Politically, there are powerful interests that like these areas of policy just as they are, and they work to keep them “hard problems.”","1725":"This course is designed to provide students with an overview of major theories and empirical approaches to the study of identity politics. Throughout the semester we will read a combination of the classics and cutting-edge research in political science, economics, psychology, exploring a range of topics with implications for politics and societies around the world. These topics include: how identity should be conceptualized and measured; why some forms of identity are activated, mobilized, and contested; how identities are represented politically; how racial and ethnic identities intersect with other salient identities; how social diversity and civil society are interrelated; what factors affect the integration of immigrants; and which varieties of democracy enable the flourishing of plural identities. Readings for these topics will focus on the United States and the other parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America.","1726":"This seminar will begin by studying the rise and spread of the notion of human rights, examining some of the core debates over human rights, including their enforcement in times of war. It will then turn to the laws of war, focusing especially on the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the challenges posed to the Conventions by the rise of non-state actors wielding significant violence. Topics include child soldiers, war crimes, humanitarian intervention, torture, targeted killings, humanitarianism, and the international justice. Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors concentrating in Political Science or International Relations.","1727":"This seminar will explore the role that Congressional investigations have historically played at the intersection of politics, public policy, tension between the executive and legislative branches, law and media, focusing on certain of the seminal Congressional investigations that both reflected and re-shaped the politics of the day. These will include the Pecora investigation into the 1929 stock market crash, the Truman Committee investigation into defense contracting during World War II, the House Un-American Activities Committee, the McCarthy hearings, Watergate. the Iran-Contra hearings and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearings into the financial services industry.","1728":"In this course we will seek to understand the evolution of democracy as a word, as a regime type, as a decision-making mechanism, as a modus vivendi, and as an essentially contested concept. We will also probe the relationships between democracy and law, democracy and peace, and democracy and sovereignty.","1729":"Managing migration waves is one of the big challenges of our time, one that is destined to increase in importance as climate change, conflicts, and economic inequality continue pushing people to move. This course provides an overview of cutting-edge research on the causes and consequences of migration. We will evaluate some of the common beliefs about migration using scientific studies: Is it true that most migrants are poor? Do restrictive policies discourage migration? Are immigrants good or bad for the economy? We will discuss the questions at the center of the political debate on migration and critically evaluate each argument based on scientific knowledge. Our discussions will be rooted in specific country cases (Ukraine, Syria, Bangladesh, East Africa, Pacific Islands,…), which we will use to learn about migration episodes and as a basis for a fact-based discussion.","1730":"Latines have often been described as the sleeping giant of United States politics. Although Latines make up nearly one in five people in the United States, the group has the lowest political participation rates of all the racial\/ethnic groups in the United States. During this course, we will consider how Latines interact with United States politics. We begin by discussing Latine ethnicity and analyzing the extent to which Latines have politicized identities. We will examine historical and demographic trends, including immigration patterns and Latine social\/labor movements, to see whether historical trends explain present behavior. We will also discuss topics related to Latine public opinion, voting patterns, and political representation. We will use what we learn during the course to discuss what role, if any, Latines will play in the future of United States politics.","1731":"Struggles over racist monuments—from defacement, to unsanctioned removal by protesters, to laws passed to “protect” statues—raise important questions about the political impact of commemoration. From the perspective of political theory, this course will analyze the civic work of monuments. Some of the key questions we will grapple with include: Do monuments matter? What civic function do they serve? When should they be removed? Thinking critically about monuments will allow students to consider how public memory is produced, whom it should represent, and what forms of commemoration are appropriate in diverse democratic societies.","1732":"Concentrators who have given evidence of superior work in political science may be admitted to honors seminar on the basis of an application submitted in the spring of their junior year.

Course only open to Political Science PhD students.","1738":"The influence of bureaucratic policymaking looms large. Some estimates suggest that 90% of laws in the United States arise government agencies, not from elected legislatures. When do public bureaucracies abet democratic governance? When do they disrupt or abet anti-democratic political forces? What roles do “publics” play in “public bureaucracy?” This course on public bureaucracy considers these questions—and many more—through its systematic study of bureaucratic structures, politics, operations, and implications for democratic governance. The course provides opportunities to critique and construct theories and empirical analyses of public bureaucracies. It also provides opportunities for students to prepare for the comprehensive exams and to develop research agendas. This graduate course counts either as an American Politics or Comparative Politics elective for the doctoral program in political science, and it does not have prerequisites.","1739":"Provides a survey of major approaches, issues, and debates in the field of comparative politics.

Readings will come from Supreme Court cases and prominent texts in political\/legal theory. Topics will include free speech, privacy, abortion, and capital punishment. Our aim is two fold. We want to understand the basic framework and content of the United States constitution as it has been elaborated by the Supreme Court. But we also want to go beyond this legal understanding and to challenge existing jurisprudence. To this end we draw on classic and contemporary texts in political theory.","1742":"This course covers the main currents of comparative political economy. This sub-field has roots in International Political Economy, Fiscal and Economic Sociology, and Economics. It has as its main foci the politics of economic growth, distribution and (in)equality. The growth program emerged from work on comparative capitalisms in the 1970s and 1980s, coalescing in the highly influential Varieties of Capitalism literature in the 2000s, and latterly in the Growth Models research program. The distributional strand of work focused on the interaction of producer groups and sought to tie political and economic outcomes to the relative strength of such groups. The (in)equality side of the subfield emerged out of studies of welfare states and engagement with the social metrics of comparative economic performance. This course surveys this broad terrain.","1743":"Covers a number of topics linked to urban politics and urban public policy. Topics include the politics of urban education, affordable housing, downtown development.

Approach Wittgenstein in context, reading other classics in the philosophy of language: Locke’s Essay on Human Understanding, Merleau-Ponty’s The World of Perception, JL Austin’s How To Do Things With Words, Jacques Derrida’s “Signature Event Context,” and Stanley Cavell’s Must We Mean What We Say? We ask: what does it mean to be a linguistic creature? Is language a cut that agentifies, a rupture that alienates, a practice that humanizes, an ideological fortress that concretizes relations of inequality, or a game? Will include films: Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench (Chazelle), Sorry to Bother You (Riley), and Dancer in the Dark (von Trier).","1746":"In this course we explore the field’s most important recent contributions to the study of political theory and the environment. We investigate the basis and scope of our obligations to the natural world; our obligations to one another with respect to the exploitation, degradation, and preservation of the natural environment; and our obligations to ourselves as individuals with respect to the natural environment. We then consider what political principles, institutions, and practices might best enable us to meet these obligations. Readings include Jane Bennett, Melissa Lane, John Dryzek, Cass Sunstein, Martha Nussbaum, Wendell Berry, Peter Singer, and others.","1747":"A careful reading of Karl Marx’s work, with special emphasis on Marx as a philosopher of freedom and on his relevance today. The core of the class gives substantial attention to Capital, Marx’s unfinished magnum opus, but will also look at earlier works to understand what Marx understood by a ‘critique of political economy.’","1748":"This graduate seminar offers an introduction to the design and implementation of social science research that deploys qualitative data and analysis in conjunction with other methods of inquiry. We explore the set of tools that is conventionally considered to comprise qualitative methods, including case studies, small-N comparisons, process tracing, sequential analysis, interviews and participant observation. Starting from the premise that each research method has its strengths and weaknesses, we also consider how qualitative methods can be combined productively with other methods of inquiry, including “large-N” quantitative analysis, experiments, spatial\/geographic analysis, and multilevel analysis spanning different scales.","1749":"This course introduces students to statistical theory and quantitative methods commonly used in political science and public policy. The course focuses on statistical inference using multiple techniques of regression analysis and gives students opportunities to become proficient users of the statistical software package R as they develop statistical models and analyze their data.

This course focuses on creating: from a class zine to creative projects. Taught in English with elements of Portuguese. No previous Portuguese language experience required.","1757":"Focuses on the representation of immigrants, migrants and other &quot;border crossers&quot; in contemporary literature from Brazil and other countries. How do people respond to the loss of home and the shift to a new culture? Is &quot;going home&quot; possible? How do individuals deal with their dual or triple identities? Piñon, Lispector, Scliar, Rushdie, Salih, Cristina Garcia, V. S. Naipaul and others. Conducted in English. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.","1758":"How do we construct our own identity as life becomes a multitude of narrative threads intersecting and overlapping like roadways on a map? How do we reconfigure identities vis-à-vis those who surround us? We will investigate the ever-changing map of cultural identities and its repercussions on human existence via contemporary literature and a series projects that incorporate the arts (visual, digital, literary) and oral history. Some of the writers include Julia Alvarez, Kiran Desai, Junot Diaz, Milton Hatoum, Chang-Rae Lee, Clarice Lispector, Dinaw Mengestu, Nélida Piñon, Salman Rushdie, Taiye Selasi and others.

We will give special focus to the work of Indigenous artists, authors, and filmmakers engaged in activism and advocacy for Indigenous rights. The course will feature Indigenous artists, writers, activists, and scholars as guest speakers, offering firsthand perspectives. Utilizing campus resources the seminar will serve as a unique platform for an in-depth examination of present-day Indigenous arts within the Brazilian context. Conducted in English.","1762":"Anthropocenic exhaustion begs for new\/old artistic modes of gathering and collectivity. How can we think, do, create, perform, listen, sense, perceive, and generate future-oriented imaginaries based on the texture of ancient ways? This collaborative humanities course centers perspectives, translations, and mediations from and about the Américas. We seek to decenter the liberal humanism of environmental thinking to present modes of being that emerge from the otherwise of the Américas. This imaginary is pluralistic in its linguistic, racial, ethnic, and gendered imagination. It foregrounds submerged perspectives and unearths subterranean stories that confront legacies of (neo)colonialism, racial capitalism, and extractivist exploitation. Guest participants — with the support of the Brown Arts and Cogut Institutes, Modern Culture and Media, and Portuguese and Brazilian Studies — enliven our study across the U.S., Turtle Island, and Abya Yala (the Indigenous nomenclature for the Américas).","1763":"Portuguese sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos states that nowadays, there is a “global hegemony of human rights as a discourse of human dignity” (2015: 22). Nonetheless, Sousa Santos observes that this hegemony is challenged by a reality of widespread human rights abuses. What then, is the value of human rights and what role does literature play in the discursive construction and the praxis of human rights? This course examines how contemporary Brazilian literature conceptualizes human rights through topics such as authoritarianism, class, race, urban space. The course also establishes connections between human rights in Brazilian and select Spanish American texts.","1764":"Focuses on representations of the self as a &quot;supreme fiction&quot; in Brazilian novels since the late 19th. century.

In addition, the various roles of key institutions in the budgeting process will be studied.","1770":"Broad overview of public policy analysis and program evaluation with emphasis on methodological issues involved in the analysis and assessment of government programs. Illustrations are drawn from a variety of substantive policy areas.","1771":"This course provides concepts and tools for thinking critically about the political context in which policy is made and implemented. The course examines the underlying ideas, interests, and historical legacies that make politics and policymaking distinctive in different countries and governmental systems. It aims to supply a simple but flexible conceptual toolbox that enables students to define policy challenges as they take shape, propose programs and implement policies that can work in various settings.","1772":"We live in the era of data-driven decision making in all aspects of our lives. The features on your iPhone, the images in an ad campaign, even the background colors on many websites are all carefully tested and chosen against their measurable impact on customer satisfaction, purchasing, clicks, or some other goal. In this course, we will be learning to use and apply those same principles to public policy and government programs. Our goal is to equip MPA students with the tools required to set up experiments, gather data, and begin to evaluate and design public policy and government programs.","1773":"This class will introduce you to various types of policy stakeholders, from executives to the mass public. You will identify those actors, the combination of authorities, powers, interests, and constraints each one possesses. This framework for viewing stakeholders will enable you to strategize about how to engage different actors when and where they intervene in the policy process. As a policymaker, analyst, or advocate, you will have to contend with stakeholders that possess formal authorities to shape the policy process. These stakeholders will determine whether the problems that concern you reach the agenda; whether your preferred solution is adopted; how that policy solution is implemented; whether it diffuses from one political venue to another; and whether the policy endures, or reshapes politics, succumbs to termination or reform. We will catalog those authorities and powers and observe how they apply in real policy situations.","1774":"This course introduces students to concepts and tools relevant to making public decisions informed by social values. It equips students to define problems and to systematically develop and compare policy options available to public actors. In short, the course teaches students to “think like a policy analyst” and reason in the public interest. In addition, the course is attentive to the political and institutional context in which policy decisions are made.","1775":"This course considers the cases for and implications of government intervention in the economy. When is government intervention desirable? Why is it desirable? What are its consequences?","1776":"Covers social and economic statistics and their role in public policy research.

Conceptual topics include the normative assignment of responsibility with federal systems and the equitable distribution of income. Specific policy applications are covered.","1778":"Students in Leading for Impact will explore multiple leadership paradoxes such as: in every context, people are both more connected than ever—mostly digitally—and at the same time more socially and politically polarized, and lonely, than ever. Engaging with the concepts of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in an authentic and vulnerable way is critical for leaders. Creating impact requires a thorough understanding of the problem at hand. A common mistake policy-makers, politicians, executives, or social business founders make is to address the problem they want to tackle as if it were “technical” i.e. only requiring expertise and appropriate tools. However, wicked problems have “adaptive” aspects: their root causes and their impact have to do with people’s beliefs, values, habits, or behaviors. Leaders need to use Emotional Intelligence to leverage their own strengths as well as the conditions that enable success,","1779":"The objective of this course is, precisely, to offer those insights to students interested in a career in policymaking by providing case studies of the most important and challenging policy questions of our lifetimes. By the end of the course, students will have deepened their understanding of the most important policy challenges from an array of different policy questions and studying the evidence around them, with a special focus on quantitative methods useful to analyze those questions.","1780":"Global health refers to the health and wellbeing of all of the world’s populations, regardless of geography, country, or citizenship. Many of today’s most pressing issues, from climate change to political conflict and population displacement, have profound implications for health. This course will introduce students to fundamental topics in global health, and it will encourage them to approach global health issues through a lens of equity and responsibility toward people and populations beyond United States’ borders. Students will develop a framework for understanding contemporary health challenges and learn how responses to these complex problems require collaboration across health and non-health sectors of society. This course will challenge students’ assumptions about world health while strengthening their skills in data literacy and critical analysis.","1781":"Introduction to the health care delivery system. An overview of the U.S. health care financing, delivery and regulatory system. Considers the interaction between paying for and providing and assuring the quality of health services; changes in one component of the system inevitably affect the others.

Presents a comprehensive overview of the environmental and behavior factors associated with health promotion and disease prevention.","1783":"PHP 0330 provides a comprehensive overview of the function, aims, methods, implementation, and evaluation of public health policy in the U.S. and globally. The course grounds public health policy within the broader framework of public policy, examining key legal, ethical, economic, and political issues, as well as issues grounded specifically in public health, paying particular attention to the tensions between policy and personal freedoms. PHP 0330 assumes that the pursuit of public health has two essential, conjoined goals: to reduce the burden of human disease and disability, and to eliminate health disparities, taking the position that health equity is a non-negotiable right and must be in the forefront of policy assessment, development, implementation, and evaluation. Although the course will focus on mature public health policy in the United States, it will do so within two broad perspectives, historical and global.","1784":"Course provides an introduction to the examination of health disparities in the U.S. Through assigned readings, lectures, guest speakers, and class discussions— this course will provide a broad overview of health disparities in the United States and examine them through intersecting structural and social determinants (e.g., race and ethnicity; gender; immigration status; socioeconomic position; age; sexual orientation; policy). This course also examines how stigma, residential segregation, implicit bias and the debates around genetics also contribute to health disparities. Lastly, we will also critically delve into the ethical dimensions, the role of social networks as well as behavioral health and public policy interventions. Community leaders will be invited to discuss their respective organizations, discuss ongoing community-university partnerships, advocacy, and networking.","1785":"In 2015, estimates of drug spend in the United States was about $457 billion and could be as high as $610 billion by 2021. The reasons for the continued escalating costs of prescription drugs are unclear. In this course we will examine the complex chain of discounts, rebates and markups that impact the price of a prescription drug from the manufacturer’s list price to the time it is dispensed to the patient. We will examine the role of major stakeholders in the drug supply chain including the manufacturer, wholesalers and distributors, pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. PHP 0310 , Healthcare in the United States, is a prerequisite. Students who feel they have adequate background and understanding of health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid and model of care delivery and financing but have not taken PHP 0310 should contact instructor for override. Students must have basic knowledge of terms associated with managed care and healthcare issues routinely written about or featured in the news.","1786":"This course approaches global public health through the lens of environmental determinants. We will examine our world’s changing environment and its relationship to health with particular focus on environmental health challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Students will explore important environmental issues that impact population health and apply public health perspectives to understanding determinants of disease and contextualizing and addressing global health challenges.","1787":"What is epidemiology? It is the study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related states and processes in specified populations and the application of this knowledge to control health problems This course will provide learners with a strong foundation in the concepts and methods needed to describe the burden of a disease in communities, identify what causes these poor health outcomes, and evaluate the impacts of interventions meant to improve health.","1788":"This is an advanced introduction to global public health, defining and critically examining key topics and concepts through an interdisciplinary lens. From historical efforts in mid-20th century international health assistance, to the early 21st century explosion of global health funding, to current efforts to decolonize global health and engage in more equitable global partnerships, this course examines major social and scientific developments. Readings, lectures, in-class discussions and small groups explore changes in the underlying causes of morbidity and mortality during global social, economic and health transitions, the biological and social ecology of global disease patterns, and efforts to improve health in under-resourced settings. Guest lecturers offer different perspectives on the global burden of disease. An in-depth research paper worth 40% of the final grade is the scholarly centerpiece of course; this is a rigorous semester-long project. There are two exams.","1789":"Focuses on principles of national health system organization and cross-national comparative analysis. Emphasizes application of comparative models to the analysis of health and health-related systems across nations. Addresses research questions related to population health and systems' performance.","1790":"This course explores food and nutrition in the US and around the world through the lens of public health, economics, and agriculture. The hybrid setting requires students to engage in and learn about the local Providence community and their own community at home from perspectives likely not previously noticed. Students will read from many sources; will review documentary films; and will write for several audiences. At the completion of this course, students will: • Describe how nutrients are consumed through foods • Explore food consumption in the US and abroad • Describe US agricultural production techniques • Propose policy changes to the current food system","1791":"Parents play an integral role in developing, supporting, and managing children's health-related behaviors. We will examine how parenting influences child behaviors and health outcomes across development, from infancy through adolescence. We will explore parenting styles, knowledge, attitudes, and practices, including specific behaviors in various domains such as food parenting and sleep parenting. Using socio-ecological models and a community-engaged approach, we will investigate how sociodemographic characteristics, culture, family structure, the physical environment, and other contextual factors impact parenting and subsequently child health behaviors and outcomes. We will discuss of the unique experiences and stressors of diverse and\/or non-traditional families including single parent households, families in poverty, LGBT families, and immigrant and\/or racial\/ethnic minorities. Finally, we will examine parenting as a modifiable intervention target to improve child health. Through it all, students will understand how parenting behaviors shape child health.","1792":"The impact of COVID-19 on US society has been profound. Caused by the newly emergent SAR-COV2 virus, the pandemic required public health practitioners and healthcare systems to pivot to keep the public safe under challenging circumstances. In the US, local municipalities, state governments, and the federal government developed varying, and at times conflicting, policies to guide the public health response. Using a case-study approach, this course will explore how public health and health policy intersected and clashed in responding to this 100-year pandemic. We will examine how different states and federal agencies responded to COVID-19 and learn from leaders directly involved in the pandemic response.","1793":"Laws and policies shape public health in profound ways. The U.S. Constitution frames and limits government authority to protect and promote public health. It also provides protections for individual rights that often are in tension with public health’s focus on the common good. Federal, state and local laws and policies structure the distribution of society’s resources and—as interpreted, implemented and enforced—can have serious implications for health equity. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deeply polarized views among Americans about the role of government in public health and has laid bare vast structural health inequities. This course will explore the Constitutional foundations of public health law; how public health powers are distributed across different levels and branches of government; legal and policy strategies for addressing infectious and chronic diseases and injuries; and the role of laws and policies in structuring—and remedying—health inequities.","1794":"This course builds an understanding of the healthcare delivery and financing systems from a health economics perspective. It will draw examples that illustrate the production of and demand for health, healthcare, and health insurance. The goals of the course are twofold.

It is geared toward students concentrating in statistics and other students who desire a course that combines the mathematical underpinnings of statistical methods with timely applications in the biological, life and health sciences and related fields. Applications to real data from a variety of studies are used throughout the course to illustrate the materials, but the emphasis is on the principles of inference and the underlying theory. This course will also give students experience manipulating and analyzing data using the R statistical software package with RStudio interface. Students will work with statistical software during the homework assignments, but this is not a course in R","1797":"This foundational course will examine how we classify substance use, substance misuse, and substance use disorders and how substance use impacts population health, including exacerbating health disparities. We will examine and compare prominent models of why people become addicted to substances. Using the socioecological model as a framework, we will analyze key risk and protective factors for substance misuse including (a) individual factors such as biological susceptibility, personality, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders, (b) interpersonal factors such as peer use and social support, (c) community factors such as access to alternative reinforcers and neighborhood resources, and (d) societal factors such as racism, social and economic inequalities, and stigma around addiction. Using this framework, we will analyze how social determinants of health impact substance use and its negative consequences in marginalized populations.","1798":"Statistical computing is an essential part of analysis. Statisticians need not only be able to run existing computer software but understand how that software functions. Students will learn fundamental concepts - Data Management, Data types, Data cleaning and manipulation, databases, graphics, functions, loops, simulation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo through working with various statistical analysis. Students will learn to write code in an organized fashion with comments. This course will be taught in a &quot;flipped&quot; format. Students will watch a series of videos and work through some simple coding examples before coming to class.","1799":"Pandemic Game Changers will examine the public health and public policy issues vital to mitigating pandemic risks. It will afford students opportunities to analyze scenarios, identify and hone policy solutions, and learn how to convince decision-makers to take the steps needed to address the public health crises that pandemics cause. Students will be required to participate in interactive Q&amp;A with field experts, perform a group analysis of an outbreak scenario, make a written and oral analysis of policy solutions for a biosecurity or biosafety risk, and provide a policy memo and persuasive oral briefing outlining views and potential next steps on one specific pandemic-related public policy issue.","1800":"This course provides a framework for studying and preventing mental disorders.

Guest speakers, and hands on field research involving interactions with people with disabilities will facilitate the students gaining a multi-layered understanding of the issues faced by people with disabilities and their families.","1802":"This course will explore how reproductive health, healthcare and freedom are regulated in the United States. The course will apply an reproductive justice framework that investigates laws, policies and practices affecting reproductive rights and bodily autonomy, but that also applies an intersectional lens to consider how race, gender, sexuality, class, ability, and immigration status affect reproduction and parenting for marginalized communities. We will also explore how religion and ideas of morality shape laws, policies and practices implicating reproductive health, bodily autonomy and notions of reproductive justice. Topics will include: eugenics, sterilization, contraception, abortion, criminal fetal endangerment laws, substance use during pregnancy, reproductive rights of incarcerated populations, access to reproductive healthcare, assisted reproduction, surrogacy, maternal health disparities, the child welfare system, and policies related to parenting and family health. Readings will include public health, law and policy analysis and landmark legal opinions.","1803":"This course is designed to introduce students to the field of environmental health, and demonstrate how environmental health is integrated into various aspects of our lives, both directly and indirectly. Topics to be covered include: toxic metals, vector-borne disease, food safety, water quality, radiation, pesticides, air quality, hazardous waste, risk assessment, and the role of the community in environmental health. Several topics will be presented by guest speakers so that students can learn from the expertise of professionals in the field. Enrollment limited to 65.","1804":"This course will be anchored by a class research project, where together, we will work through a public health topic in real-time. The overarching goal of this class is to provide students with a solid basis for understanding public health issues in rural settings, and how to carryout, thoughtful, and impactful public health studies and environmental exposure assessments in rural communities. For the Spring 2024 semester, students enrolled at Brown University and Tougaloo College will develop a public health research project based in Gloster, Mississippi, a rural community of only 897 residents, grappling with pollution coming from one of the largest wood pellet manufacturing companies in the world. We will leverage a current and ongoing air pollution monitoring network and public health study to examine the relationship between air quality and community health.","1805":"Interested students must register for IAPA 1802S .","1806":"This survey course is designed for students who want to interrogate the central role that public health policies and practices play in creating and sustaining the nation’s epidemic of incarceration. The course will focus on individuals who have experienced incarceration and the under-resourced, low-income, and medically disenfranchised communities from which these individuals come and to which most will return. Students will learn about the lived experiences of those directly impacted by the criminal legal system through invited speakers who have been incarcerated. Experts who work at the intersection of the criminal legal and health systems will also be invited to the class. Undergraduates who have taken PHP 0310 and PHP 0320 and MPH candidates will have priority for enrollment. Unfilled spaces in the class will be available to undergraduates who have not taken PHP 0310 and PHP 0320 .","1807":"This course will introduce infectious disease modeling and its applications. Students will learn to build computational models of infectious disease, fit models to data, leverage models to develop predictions, and target public health interventions. We will explore how models were used during the COVID19 pandemic, and are being used to project the health effects of climate change. We will introduce core mathematical underpinnings including dynamical systems and statistical approaches for model fitting. Students should be familiar with calculus and have prior coding experience in R, Python or Matlab.","1808":"This course provides an overview on the relation of meditation and mindfulness (the ability to attend in a nonjudgmental way to one’s own physical and mental processes during ordinary, everyday tasks) with various health outcomes and disease risk factors such as depression, anxiety, diet, substance use, and cardiovascular disease. Mechanisms by which mindfulness may influence health will be addressed. The course will assess studies in the field for methodological rigor, and students will be taught strengths and weaknesses of current research. Students will be taught various mindfulness practices including direct experience with mindfulness meditation.","1809":"Recently, the cover of Time magazine declared a “mindful revolution” due to its popularity and growing body of research suggesting that mindfulness may help to treat a number of health-related problems from general stress to anxiety to addiction. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of how it works. This course will investigate the many ways that mindfulness is measured (e.g. self-report, behavior, EEG, fMRI etc.), and use these as a doorway for our own experiential exploration of what mindfulness is for ourselves.","1810":"We are creatures of habit. Driven by biological processes set up to help us survive, our minds are constantly craving experiences and substances—from smartphones to romance to alcohol—and this craving leads to habit formation.

It also provides an overview of the contexts of that work in nonprofit organizations, including governance, management, and development.","1872":"What is happiness, and how does it relate to the &quot;good life,&quot; or a life well-lived? This is an age-old question, and in this course we will investigate religious and philosophical answers alongside insights drawn from modern positive psychology. A major goal of the course is to give you intellectual tools that will help you to construct a meaningful life. Areas of study will include value determination; gratitude; status and wealth; and mindfulness.","1873":"For centuries, scholars have looked to religious institutions, theological doctrines, and sacred texts to explain religion’s form and function in culture and society. And while this approach has enabled scholars to neatly prescribe what counts as religious, it’s also caused them to ignore the ways people’s daily faith practices make a mess of this work. Drawing on sub-fields in religious studies, anthropology, and sociology, this course explores how formal ideas of religion expand when confronted with the normality of everyday life. From cooking and talking to prayer and devotion, the “religious” and “non-religious” things people do tell us a lot about how religion animates and is animated by lived experience, and how porous the boundary is between the “sacred” and “profane”.","1874":"This course examines various forms of inequality in the ancient world as well as the range of responses to it by those who resist it and reject it. The axes of inequality we shall investigate vary from culture to culture, but often include the privileging of male\/masculine over female\/feminine, native over foreign, whole-bodied over “defective” or “blemished,” old over young, ritually pure over polluted, holy over common or profane, rich over poor, free over enslaved, honored over shamed, or the couplings of men and women over same-sex couplings. The course is comparative, with a primary focus on texts and artifacts from ancient Israel and coastal West Asia, Babylon and Assyria, Greece and Rome. Texts we will study include various passages from the Hebrew Bible (Christian Old Testament), the Epic of Gilgamesh, Hammurabi’s Laws, the Middle Assyrian Laws, the Iliad, and","1875":"Dharma—a Sanskrit word encompassing duty, ethics, law, and religion—is a common thread running through the cultures of premodern India. This course offers a history of Indian civilization from its origins up through the end of the classical period. Drawing on a rich array of textual, material, and expressive cultures, we trace the arc of human history on the subcontinent, paying special attention to the intersections of religion and politics. The sources at hand reveal the dynamic interplay between tradition and innovation, and attest to human efforts to redefine what it means to live a life according to dharma.","1876":"Death is universal but seldom discussed in contemporary culture. In this class we will address how the varieties of Buddhist religion represent and understand dying, death, and the afterlife. Using images, films, and texts, we will ask, How should we die? How does death influence the living? Is there an afterlife? What should be done with dead bodies? The class will move between theories and practices, and past and current events. Coming to terms with these diverse materials may reveal to us some of our own assumptions about death, dying, and the afterlife.","1877":"Interested students must register for JUDS 0063 .","1878":"Interested students must register for JUDS 0064 .","1879":"From LSD to magic mushrooms, mescaline to ayahuasca, psychedelics are drugs that alter consciousness and perceptions of reality. This course investigates the central role that religion and spirituality have played in the long, tangled history of psychedelics, from colonial eradication of psychedelics as indigenous sacraments, to psychedelic modes of expanding consciousness in 1960s counterculture; from the moral panic around these substances as a tool of mind control, to their present scientific investigation as a panacea for mental health, addiction, and self-realization. Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.","1880":"An introductory cultural and historical study of conservative Christianity in the United States. The Christian Right has played a defining role in American and global politics since at least the 1940s. What is the history of this movement? Who are conservative Christians, and how are they distinct from other kinds of religious actors? What, exactly, do they believe—about feminist and LGBT rights, healthcare, education, civil rights, religious liberty, and capitalism? This course explores these questions and more, with an emphasis on intersectional feminist and critical ethnic studies analysis of the themes and histories at hand. Students will analyze primary sources from the movement, complete a field visit to a thematic site of their choosing, participate in biweekly film screenings, and do a final “unessay” project related to their specific areas of interest.","1881":"What was religion like for women in the ancient Mediterranean world? What experiences, emotions, and constraints characterized women’s religious lives? What was public and what was private? What were the family issues involved? How were religions gendered? Were there major differences between religions that included goddesses and priestesses, and those that did not? Were notions of gender fixed or fluid? Could they enable religious freedoms for women? We will explore these and other questions through a consideration of religions Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian between roughly 500 BCE and 500 CE, with a focus on the Roman Empire. Discussion","1882":"A collaborative exploration of (mainly North American) Indigenous traditions, practices, and beliefs in relation to ecology. We will learn about a variety of Indigenous environmental perspectives and practices as expressed by Indigenous authors, elders, film producers, and community members. Topics will include: Indigenous knowledge systems, environmental activism, sacred lands, the importance of place, kinship relations to the human and more-than-human, climate change adaptation, storytelling, tribal and food sovereignty, and how settler colonialism and dispossession have affected Indigenous populations in their relation to the environment. Additionally, we will learn about Brown University’s relation to local Indigenous lands and populations, and how Indigenous research methods can inform the Brown community of scholars. Our community of learning will discuss broad topics that relate to life and learning at the University, and will offer guidance and support for students’ first year experience at Brown.","1883":"How have ancient societies understood friendship, and how do ancient ideas about friendship differ from or resemble those of contemporary Westerners? This seminar, a comparative investigation of the ways in which friendship has been represented in the Hebrew Bible, Mesopotamian literature, and Greco-Roman texts, will addresses these and other questions through study of materials such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Book of Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel (on Jonathan and David), the Wisdom of Ben Sira (Sirach), and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.","1884":"An introduction to the origins and early development of the indigenous religious thought of China from the oracle bone divination of the Shang Dynasty to the ethical philosophy of Confucianism and the cosmology and mysticism of Daoism. The course will seek to identify and elucidate the basic elements of the distinctive Chinese world view and demonstrate how they have shaped the nature of religious practice and experience and how they have been shaped by them. Works of interpretive scholarship will be used to supplement the primary texts in translation that will form the course. Optional lab section.","1885":"A study of the dynamic relation between religion and “nature” or the more-than-human world. Religion, in this course, includes forms of religion within and outside the bounds of conventional religious traditions. In this course, then, religion includes Buddhism, Christianity, and Aboriginal religion, but also ecofeminism, nature literature, and environmentalism. Topics in this study of religion, ethics, and environmental humanities include: religious depictions of humans in relation to “nature” and the more-than-human; the contribution of religions to environmental degradation and environmental health; religion and environmental justice; and North American and Australian indigenous eco-spiritual perspectives.","1886":"In this course we examine gender and sexuality in Muslim cultures, as well the ways in which Islam is imagined in relationship to gender and sexuality. We will think about how particular constructions of gender and sexuality affect the representation of Islam and Muslims in the US and abroad, especially in films and documentaries, which form a critical component of this course. Students will learn to engage with and complicate key terms and themes including &quot;masculinity,&quot; &quot;cultural difference,&quot; &quot;women's and LGBT rights,&quot; and &quot;modernity\/civilization&quot; that are widely, and often uncritically, deployed in current representations of Islamic culture.","1887":"Alongside their Jewish and Pagan neighbors, ancient Christians sought to control and defend themselves against unseen forces teeming around them. They bound powerful angels to their will and harnessed the spirits of the recently deceased to activate their spells. Though none found the Elixir of Life, they left behind spells, recipes, and talismans as evidence of their quest to master spirits both hostile and sympathetic. This course will interrogate Christian and non-Christian conceptions of magic, its relationship with “religion” and “philosophy,” contextualize Christian magical practices alongside their neighbors, and conclude by examining the reception of “magic” into the modern West.","1888":"From rural temple to urban shrine, to elegant synagogue or village church, from household prayer nook to adorned tomb, people in the ancient world honored, encountered, and experienced their gods. They practiced a piety in which human flourishing depended on gestures, rituals, and built articulations of devotion mediated by beauty. But holy powers could also be malevolent, so ancient art served to protect, warn, or ward off evil spirits. This course will explore the art, architecture, and material cultures of ancient Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians between the 6th century BCE and the 6th century CE. We will consider a wide variety of evidence, including texts, sculpture, frescoes, mosaics, architecture, and domestic artifacts, to explore the many ways in which these distinct but connected communities expressed their beliefs through visual representations and material practices.","1889":"From its roots in premodern India to its current popularity worldwide, yoga has a rich a complex history. As a practice of the mind, body, and spirit, yoga has taken many forms—meditation, chanting, breath control, postures—in order to achieve a range of goals: liberation from rebirth, supernatural powers, strength, pleasure, peace, wellness. As its reputation and commodification have increased, yoga has attracted deep interest, debate, and even controversy. In this course we will study yoga from its earliest texts to its status in the modern world, addressing its historical, religious, social, and political ramifications in many different contexts.","1890":"A mantra is a syllable or formula used in ritual and meditation. Mantras are central to Indian religions—not only Hinduism, but also Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Sikhism. Some mantras are made up of words and language—usually in Sanskrit—while others are sound fragments with no semantic meaning. The sacred syllable OM, now a global symbol of Eastern spirituality, exemplifies the power and authority of mantra. What are mantras? What do they accomplish? How do they shape identities, beliefs, and practices? Engaging with sacred utterance in various media, this course explores the world of mantras in India and beyond.","1891":"Who are we? How do we fit in the universe? Like many other systems of thought around the world, the Daoist tradition approached these questions both through the creation of texts, teachings, and theory, and through the development of at times extremely complex embodied contemplative practices. Starting from a perspective of a person not as a unitary, monolithic entity, but rather as a composite of energies and influences, these practices seek to harmonize, balance, and transform the person. This course will explore how the possibilities of personal transformation were expressed in Daoist contemplative literature from the first centuries CE up to the modern day. Contemplative practice labs will also offer students an opportunity to explore the ideas in the texts through direct experience. No prerequisites.","1892":"This course confronts the changing historical phenomenon we call “Confucianism” on its own terms, as represented by its advocates, as well as from the perspective of its interlocutors and critics. It is an opportunity to become familiar not only with the Confucian canon and its main commentarial traditions, which undergirded education in East Asia into the nineteenth century, but also with the ways in which these ideas were rejected, adjusted, and reconfigured in early Daoist discussions, Neo-Confucian debates with Buddhists, and modern disputes over their socioeconomic, political, and\/or gender impact. Readings are drawn from primary Chinese, Korean, and Japanese texts in translation, and from modern interpretations of Confucianism and its legacy. The course format is primarily discussion and short lecture. No prerequisites. Counts for concentration credit in East Asian Studies and Religious Studies.","1893":"When we casually hear about Zen it seems loosely associated with being cool or hip, like the seemingly mysterious “Sound of One Hand.” But what does “Zen” really mean and how did it come into the modern Western cultural landscape? We explore the Zen traditions of East Asia and trace their transmission to the West through a study of their writings and practices. From the arrival of Zen master Shaku Sōen Kogaku at the Parliament of World Religions in 1893, through the writings of D.T. Suzuki, to the Beat Zen of the 1950’s and the establishment of centers of Zen practice, we will help you to appreciate in your own lives what the Daily Show calls your “moments of Zen.”","1894":"In this class, we will explore the culture and practice of contemporary Islam in a variety of geographical contexts. From the United States to South Asia, from Europe to the Middle East, we will look at how Islam is practiced, discursively shaped, and represented across a variety of media. We will also introduce and learn about major phenomena including orientalism, colonialism modernity, and the post-modern--what do these terms mean, and why are they relevant to understanding the Islamic world? No previous study of Islam or religious studies is required for this course, and it is open to all undergraduates.","1895":"Interested students must register for JUDS 0608 .","1896":"This online course is an introduction to the history of emotion. How do we feel, and how do we know what we feel? How did concepts like shame, pride, wonder, happiness, or grief change over time?   Are emotions primarily the result of neurological processes, or are they learned and performed within culturally determined social constructs? And finally, what are the politics of emotional expression from the point of view of racial, religious, and gender differences? We will explore these questions and more through readings on the theory and history of emotion, various media sources, and pre-modern as well as modern literature.","1897":"Intensive introduction to classical and contemporary theories of religion and the principal methods for the study of religion. Junior seminar for religious studies concentrators. Enrollment limited to 25.","1898":"Interested students must register JUDS 1630 .","1899":"Who was the Virgin Mary? How did she become important, when and to whom? What was inherited? What was new? How were Mary’s meanings demonstrated? A study in the developing theological and devotional traditions regarding Mary the Mother of Jesus, focused on the first thousand years of Christian history. Major theological positions; relationship to pre-existing religious practices and goddess traditions; the role of popular violence; Marian piety; Marian relics; Mary as cultural metaphor. Seminar format.","1900":"This advanced seminar treats the central ideas in the thought of Zizek, Sloterdijk, Bauman, and others. It will pay particular attention to the idea of God in the works of Derrida, Foucault, and Deleuze as it filters through these contemporary, popular efforts. Students will trace some of the normative aspects of a postmodern ethics and theology by looking at &quot;Emergent&quot; churches, &quot;New Thought&quot;, and post-foundational Christian theology in practice.","1901":"Exploration of Japanese Buddhist sensibilities as expressed in poetry, popular tales, drama, and fiction. Recurring themes include wrongdoing and its karmic consequences; renunciation; tension between aesthetic and religious commitments; pilgrimage as creative process; the role of nature in the quest for enlightenment. Reading and discussion in a seminar-style format. A previous course in Buddhism or East Asian culture is helpful but not required. Counts for concentration credit in Religious Studies and East Asian Studies.","1902":"A survey of Muslim presence in South Asia. We will trace historical development of communities, including the arrival of Muslims in the subcontinent, establishment of various polities in the medieval period, and the evolution of modern colonial and postcolonial states. Paying attention to religious ideas, literary expression in numerous languages, and art and architecture, we will treat Islam as a multidimensional factor embedded within diverse South Asian intellectual and cultural contexts. Readings include original materials in translation and academic studies from various humanities and social science fields.","1903":"Community as an ideal promises a common life with others, sharing norms and values. On the other hand, it can easily engender stultifying conformity and homogeneity. Religion has and continues to play a key role in forming communities. This course will examine questions surrounding community, with a particular focus on how communities cope with loss, suffering, and trauma. We will also pose questions about the boundaries of communities, including ecological questions about community between humans and non-humans. We will pay special attention to Jewish thought on these issues. Readings will include Derrida, Levinas, Butler, and Latour.","1904":"This course is a culminating experience for the Religious Studies concentration. While introductory gateway courses introduced concentrators to the discipline and upper-level courses examined particular topics or methodologies, this capstone seminar provides concentrators with an opportunity to synthesize what they have learned, while also delving more deeply into the themes and topics that they find most central to their own interests. Thesis writers receive support including small group interaction and supportive criticism. Non-thesis writers create a capstone portfolio over the course of the semester. Through activities and guest presentations, all concentrators will connect their studies to their future goals.","1905":"This seminar examines diverse methodological and theoretical resources for studying religion. Readings may include influential recent theorists from across the humanities and social sciences, as well as contemporary scholars of religion who bring such theorizing to bear on religion.","1906":"Is America fundamentally defined by Romanticism? We will explore the sustained legacies of Romanticism in America, giving special attention to the interrelated topics of religion, democracy, and the environment, by reading such authors as Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Thoreau, Whitman, and Fredrick Douglas; William James, George Santayana, and W.E.B. Du Bois; and Terry-Tempest Williams, Barry Lopez, and Wendell Berry.","1907":"Each week we will engage in close reading through translation of Buddhist texts in the original Chinese.

Many scientific workers–including translators, activists, archivists, technicians, curators, and ethics review boards–are absent in publications and omitted from stories of discovery. Professional scientists are often celebrated, yet they are expected to uphold principles of ‘objective’ self-denial. This course will explore these silences and omissions to reveal how invisibilities have shaped twentieth and twenty-first century science. The course modules invites comparisons across geographic, temporal, and disciplinary boundaries. The modules also facilitate different forms of self-reflexive practice, and will open the possibilities of research avenues for students; how we should approach research and narrative method; and how contemporary interest in invisible labor relates to established discursive traditions in the historiography of science and STS.","1937":"What is &quot;science&quot;? How do scientific ideas become knowledge? What is the nature of scientific objectivity, how can it be compromised? What is a scientific community, scientific consensus, and scientific authority? What roles does science play in our culture, and how is science related to other social institutions and practices? The interdisciplinary field of science studies is introduced through exploration of topics that include: gender and race, psychiatric classification, the drug industry, science and religion, and the use of nuclear weapons during World War II.

The history of colonialism, enslavement, and plantations are also intertwined in ruin of the environment. Feminist science studies provide a guide to the arts of noticing and staying with the troubles of our time but also for imagining otherwise. In this course we gather hope from ecofeminism in order to move towards a justice-oriented future. We do this by delving into the literature on ecofeminism alongside ecological speculative fiction. Recognizing that solutions to environmental problems require a feminist attunement, we can start to understand the implications that our ethical commitments have to the future of life on the planet.","1939":"Using examples from everyday life, this course investigates how preferences for certain technologies are shaped by social arrangements that reflect power relations. By considering the origins, materiality, and practices of use for a diverse range of technologies, from the digital to the reproductive, this course will interrogate the socio-political and ethical fallout of consumer, infrastructural, personal, legal, and medical technologies. Reading about the history and anthropology of technology, watching films that engage the reception and making of science and technology, and imagining the future of technological solutions, this course analyzes how technologies are used to create and maintain boundaries around social categories of race, nation, sex, gender, and ability.","1940":"This is an advanced seminar that uses a Problem Based Learning style pedagogy to explore real-world problems in STS.

Sociology explores the workings of societies large and small: nations, organizations, communities, families, and other groups. How do societies shape action and identity, and why are social pressures so hard to defy? How do societies distribute wealth and power, and why do inequalities so often coalesce around race, ethnicity, class, and gender? How do established practices persist, and when do movements arise to challenge them? Examining such themes across a range of issues and topics, this course provides a springboard for future study throughout the social sciences.","1945":"This course will explore contemporary frameworks and methodological approaches underpinning the sociological study of sex, gender, and sexuality. In addition to delving into key debates about sex, gender, and sexuality, this course will critically examine the social construction of sex, gender, and sexuality within different institutions and social contexts. Throughout the course, close attention will be paid to understanding how sex, gender, and sexuality are mutually constituted alongside other systems of inequality, such as race, ethnicity, class, and nationality, as well as how moments of tension, resistance, and change emerge.","1946":"We live in a society of organizations. We are born inside organizations, we are educated inside organizations, we work inside organizations, and when we die, we will be buried by organizations. Organizations are therefore central to processes that shape individual lives and societal trends, from widening income inequality, to the spread of innovations, to struggles over public policy. This course introduces the field of Organizational Studies, examining organizations as complex, multifaceted social settings. By investigating how organizations and society shape each other, students will build skills for informed, socially-responsible engagement in an increasingly organizational society.","1947":"A study of self in contemporary society. We examine the structural and situational forces that shape the self and their impact on personal development, orientations to the world, and interpersonal behavior; we investigate the development of the self as a way of being in the world that makes everyday doings and, ultimately society, possible. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students. Instructor permission required.","1948":"In American society a paradox exists: education is both a conduit of mobility and inequality. Schooling offers the potential for greater opportunities; yet the disparate nature of school-communities often compound disadvantages for others. In this course, we explore the complex “ecology” of educational inequality, from macro- to micro-dimensions, exploring economics, housing, intergroup dynamics, race and racism, gender and sexism, poverty and class, and other phenomena. It will provide students with a basis for understanding the relationship between education and society, and we will explore the intersectional ways that group distinctions, material and political realities impact people’s lives.","1949":"We start from the assumption that the social organization of society shapes definitions and experiences of health and illness, the distribution of diseases, and the responses to them. We explore the relevance of social structure and social interaction to health and well-being, emphasizing socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, and social contexts such as relationships, families, schools, and neighborhoods. This is not a &quot;sociology of medicine&quot; course. It will not emphasize the profession of medicine, health care policy, or health care organizations. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students. Instructor permission required.","1950":"The course examines the main theories in the Sociology of race, racism and discrimination. It focuses on how race patterns the experiences of ethno-racial groups and simultaneously defines the contours of systemic racism and inequality. It teaches students how to lead and participate in critical discussions, collaborate on the analysis of data, write research-based policy proposals with a client orientation, and engage with current issues surrounding the sociology of race, discrimination and racism. While the focus is primarily sociological, the course takes a multivalent approach to examine how racial inequality persists in a presumably “post-racial” society.","1951":"The central questions of economic life are questions of value: how much are things worth? How do we establish those values? Who decides? Climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental injustice make these inquiries even more urgent: how should we allocate resources to support life on Earth? Through a focus on nature and climate, this course introduces students to the ways that politics, culture, and morality shape economic processes. We will also encounter other tricky questions of value, like valuing human life, knowledge, and art. Students will leave with a foundation in economic sociology – an essential conceptual lens at a time when environmental and many other social problems demand multivalent conceptions of value.","1952":"In this first-year seminar, we will analyze the intricate ways in which gender permeates the world of work (paid and unpaid) and fuels inequality. The course explores intersections of gender, race, and class, with a focus on the 20th and 21st century United States. We will cover a range of topics from segregation and discrimination to care work and emotional labor, and decode how policy and labor movements are shaping the future of work. This course invites students to engage with a variety of theories and methods, paving the way for a deeper understanding of gender and stratification.","1953":"Efforts are underway across college and university campuses—in the United States and globally—to increase opportunities for community-engaged teaching, learning, and research. What is engaged scholarship and how does it challenge (and\/or complement) more traditional concepts of scholarship and disciplinary knowledge? What are the historical, practical, methodological, ethical, and other considerations associated with engaged scholarship? Through investigating these and other questions, students will emerge from this course with a critical understanding of engaged scholarship at Brown University and in the broader landscape of U.S. higher education. Students will be equipped to design a course of study that integrates community practice with academic knowledge throughout the remainder of their time at Brown and beyond. SOC 0310 fulfills a requirement for the Engaged Scholarship Certificate.","1954":"This course introduces the research and policies related to international migration, a phenomenon involving the dynamic movement of people across borders. The class provides the theoretical and empirical tools required to understand immigration's main theories and empirical debates. The course examines why people migrate and how and why immigrants settle where they do. Additionally, the class examines the structural forces influencing the experiences of immigrant groups in American society and the consequences of international migration for both immigrants and native-born citizens in the United States. Through readings, research, and discussions, students acquire skills needed to objectively analyze how immigration patterns people's lives and simultaneously shapes the boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in society.","1955":"How is modern society organized? What holds society together and what drives social change? Why is there such a large gap between the &quot;modern&quot; ideal of formal equality and the reality of factual inequality? Why do differences of class, race and gender persist? What is power and who has it? These questions have motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the arguments continue to be informed by the foundational classical theorists: Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and W.E.B Du Bois. Looking at the transformations around them – the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the spread of colonialism, the decline of religion, struggles for emancipation and much more – they developed arguments that allow us to better understand ourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic and social transformations around us. We explore the defining contributions of these theorists and link them to current debates and theories on systemic racism, gender\/sex struggles, global inequalities, social movements and democracy.","1956":"This course aims to impart a critical perspective of, and an empirical familiarity with, the range of methods available to sociological researchers to answer interesting, important, and complex social research questions. It introduces students to the frameworks and methods of conducting sociological research -- from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. We will examine broadly defined methodological approaches to doing sociology such as survey research, ethnography and interviews, and historical\/comparative studies. These methodological approaches correspond to distinct conceptualizations of social life and the science dedicated to studying it. Over the course of the semester, students will focus on developing a fully feasible research proposal.","1957":"Introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics: measures of central tendencies and variability, sampling, tests of significance, correlation, and regression. Also includes the use of computers in data analysis. Knowledge of elementary algebra is assumed. Enrollment is limited to 144 students.","1958":"This course provides a comprehensive introduction to America’s criminal court system and all its institutional stakeholders. We will examine America’s criminal court system from myriad of different perspectives: courts as organizations, courts as social arrangements of professionals, courts as providers of social services and courts as consumer institutions – providing the experience of justice to victims, witnesses, defendants and jurors. We will focus on state courts as well as the federal system.","1959":"This course introduces students to a range of qualitative research methods commonly used in market and social science research. It is designed to provide students with a skill set that will allow them to conduct and design market and social research that gets below the surface of the traditional survey. Focus groups, ethnographic observation and user-centered research are widely used in product design, communications, marketing and entrepreneurship research. Students will learn and practice all of the methods introduced in the course by conducting a semester-long research project, will gain insight into which methods are most appropriate for particular research needs.","1960":"This course brings design thinking into conversation with qualitative research methods, examining the elements of a comprehensive perspective of context. It introduces students to design research methods, ethnographic research methods, and how they work together. Students will learn how to use these methods to identify and engage in &quot;deep hanging out&quot; with the problem, gap or inefficiency in question. They will then move on to patient contextualized opportunity identification for meaningful innovation. By the end of the course, students will have developed a process for effective, through innovation context analysis. Relevant for designers of products, services, organizations , and experience.","1961":"This course covers the theory and practice of survey research. Topics include questionnaire design and formatting; sample design and selection; interviewing techniques; data base design and data entry; and elementary data analysis and report production. Students will design, construct, administer, and analyze a survey for a Brown community partner.","1962":"Applies sociological analysis to understand present and historical cases of ethnic and race relations and conflicts. Topics addressed are the social construction of race and ethnicity; historical processes of racialization; ethnic conflict and the nation state; and the linkages between race, class, and social mobility. Focuses on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S., but also has a strong international comparative component.","1963":"Micro-Organizational Theory focuses on the human dynamics of organizations as natural systems. It examines how individual attitudes, actions, and interactions make a difference for organizational processes and outcomes. This focus is contrasted with more macro-level approaches, which take the organization (instead of the individual) as the primary unit of analysis. For example, studies of organizations from an economic perspective are typically concerned with the performance of the organization relative to its competitors. Studies of organizations from a macro-sociological focus are typically concerned with an organization's routines and structures, contextualized by the broader environment. SOC 1311 takes a more micro and meso perspective that asks questions such as, &quot;why do individuals in organization behave the way they do, how does this affect the organizations of which they are a part and how, in turn, are individuals affected by their organizations?&quot;","1964":"Macro-Organizational Theory focuses on the organization and its social\/economic environment. This class will explore various definitions of the organization’s environment, and the many types of macro-level organizational structures in which sets of organizations interact, function, compete, and cooperate. Important questions to be asked include the following: -What is an organizational environment and how do organizations “deal” with what is outside of their boundaries? -How are the boundaries of organizations defined\/recognized\/function? -How do environments influence organizational strategy and performance? -What are the major theories for assessing macro-level organizational phenomena? -What are the many ways in which organizations relate to other organizations?","1965":"An introduction to the fundamental principles and methods of geographic information systems (GIS). Topics include (a) handling different types of geographic datasets, (b) geo-analytical and modeling tools in GIS, (c) conceptual and theoretical aspects of GIS application development, and (d) errors and uncertainty analysis of GIS applications. Laboratory assignments and the project work provide hands on experiences in GIS. Enrollment limited to 42 juniors and seniors.","1966":"This course focuses on the changing experience of immigrants in American society. It builds on the premise that periods of social transformation are central to understanding the process of integration of people moving across borders and settling in particular locales. The course engages theories of immigrant incorporation to examine processes of identity formation and societal integration. The course also considers how immigrant integration is a major force reshaping social and political ideologies as well as how new patterns of exclusion emerge as immigrants confront the denial of resources, opportunities and access to citizenship.","1967":"Women’s “empowerment” is a means and ends to international development. From microfinance self-help groups that foster women’s businesses, to corporate social responsibility projects that promote girls’ education, to campaigns against domestic violence, developmental initiatives target women. These projects are motivated by the commonsense understanding that focusing on women will not only make women better off, but also their families, neighborhoods, and the entire nation. This course analyzes the evolution and effects of women as a global solution to poverty. How did women become the targets of development? Are women empowered by development schemes we find today in their names?","1968":"How bad is climate change, and how much worse it will get? How are global inequalities’ changing? What are their consequences? How is white supremacy implicated here? What is our responsibility in analyzing\/engaging these questions? You have at least an implicit response to these questions and others addressing global transformations. This course will help refine your understandings by inviting you to consider the actors, structures, norms and powers shaping how change works and why we judge its expressions as we do. Across multiple areas of global change, we compare conceptions of power and justice in their various articulations.","1969":"Global and local processes and patterns of inequality reflect and perpetuate persistent, unethical, health inequities. This advanced seminar will introduce students to research on life course health and aging. In the first part of the course, we will review sociological approaches to understanding health, and variation in health and wellness, over time and across place and communities, as well as over life courses and generations. In the second part of the course, we will apply our learning to design and conduct a research study.","1970":"For the first time, most people across the globe live in cities. Inequalities within both nations and cities are increasingly similar across national boundaries. This course ask how the politics of formal and informal institutions in cities produce and change inequalities of shelter, work, race, and other social identities, across urban space. We analyze cases from across the globe, along with a range of social science methods and theoretical perspectives.","1971":"In this upper level undergraduate course for which there are no prerequisites, we consider how sociology, and other social sciences, help us understand martial arts and other bodymindful practices (including yoga!) and how they might inform the social sciences. We consider how these practices, their organizations, and their cultures shape, and are shaped by, different structures of power and privilege. We concentrate on martial arts because they straddle such an important axial dimension of society around violence. Enrollment limited to 20.","1972":"We will examine US race, racism, and racial inequality through the lens of critical race theory. We start with an examination of the development of critical race theory in the legal academy and explore the foundational principles of the theoretical framework. We will utilize a critical race frame to analyze the law as a tool of the US racial state, a mechanism through which the state has created and maintained race privilege and corresponding racial oppression. We will also compare the critical race paradigm that developed in the legal academy to some of the most critical race perspectives in sociology.","1973":"This class examines the racial origins of wrongful conviction in the U.S. criminal justice system. We examine how wrongful conviction is created through both formal laws as well as social norms of practice that obscure how racial bias infiltrates seemingly race-neutral areas of due process. While legal scholars and lawyers examine wrongful conviction as a type of “misfire” in an otherwise functioning criminal justice system, this course considers how wrongful conviction is type of social system within the mainstay of the criminal justice system, at large. In the tradition of W.E.B. Du Bois, we examine how racism is the engine of this social system that is best referred to as “mass wrongful conviction.”","1974":"Infant health has become increasingly unequal since 2010. Medical improvements and greater access to health insurance predict greater equality, but underweight and preterm births have become increasingly likely for unmarried and Black mothers with low levels of education. Why? What contributes to infant health and how could policies improve outcomes for marginalized mothers? This course examines contexts and resources that shape infant health and how infant health shapes life chances for children. Infant health is a central connection between generations and a valuable focus to learn how to increase equality of opportunity in the U.S.","1975":"This course considers spatial aspects of inequality in metropolitan neighborhoods in the United States. We will examine the social and economic forces driving patterns of urban inequality, drawing from sociological readings on topics such as housing, education, segregation, gentrification, neighborhood effects, and concentrated poverty. Students will investigate the consequences of these inequalities for individuals and their communities, and analyze the effectiveness of policies in addressing or exacerbating stratification. This course will be discussion-based and interactive, requiring weekly preparation and active exchange during class.","1976":"How do institutions, policies, and structures shape the health of individuals and populations? How has healthcare changed over time? To what extent are the concepts of “health”, “illness”, and “disability” innate or socially constructed? This course will tackle these questions, and more, through the study of medical sociology. The course is designed for undergraduates with at least some familiarity with sociological concepts. Throughout the course, students will learn to apply theoretical and empirical insights from the readings to real-world situations. Most readings will focus on the United States, but we will occasionally read and discuss research on other countries.","1977":"Recent transformations in capitalism owing to the pervasive production and commercial use of data, including personal data of users of internet-related services, have seen proclamations such as “data is the new oil” and “you are the product”, and the rise of new analytical concepts such as “digital”\/“data”\/“surveillance”\/“platform”\/“information” capitalism. But what do we mean when we say data, where does it come from, what does it have it to do with capitalism, and why does any of it matter? This course aims to answer these questions, by examining the technology and data-driven transformations in political economy and society.","1978":"Religion, in general, and Christianity, in particular, have had an indelible influence in the lives of Americans, especially African Americans. Why? What common themes, beliefs, and rituals exist for these two cultural systems? How do they tend to be appropriated and understood? Moreover, how does spirituality manifest as a viable response? Research by seminal sociologist and community activist W.E.B. Du Bois and other scholars of race and racism will inform answers to these and other questions. The course will examine whether and how religion, Christianity, and spirituality influence the lives and quality of life of diverse groups. Special attention will be given to their usage by African Americans.","1979":"Advanced seminar for sociology and social analysis and research (SAR) concentrators. Participants examine methods for analyzing, writing, and presenting capstone and thesis material and apply peer review techniques in assessing each other's work. Culminates in presentation of capstone or thesis to the department. Required for all sociology and social analysis and research (SAR) concentrators.","1980":"Introduction to probability, descriptive statistics and statistical inference.

Major areas within sociology are integrated with the study of population, including the comparative–historical analysis of development, family processes, social stratification, ethnicity, ecological studies, and social policy. Primarily for first year Graduate students.","1986":"This course offers an in-depth understanding of the sociological study of gender and sexualities. In addition to examining contemporary theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches, we will interrogate the social construction of gender and sexualities within a variety of institutions and social contexts, such as families, schools, work, health and medicine, technology, and popular culture. Throughout the course, close attention will be paid to understanding how gender and sexualities intersect with other systems of inequality, such as race, class, age, nationality, and disability. Although empirical research will primarily draw from the United States, some transnational perspectives will also be considered. Students will leave this course with a strong understanding of gender and sexualities within macro, meso, and micro levels of society, as well as how moments of tension, resistance, and change occur.","1987":"We spend a great deal of our waking hours working, either paid or unpaid. In what ways is gender embedded in work, and how does work reflect and reinforce gender inequality? This seminar will provide an overview of contemporary theory and research on gender and work. Throughout the course, we will consider gender in relation to race and ethnicity, and we will pay close attention to how gender and race at work translates into class and inequality. Our primary focus will be on the United States in the 20th and 21st centuries, with some comparisons with other nations. Readings will include a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Topics covered include: gender segregation and pay gaps, labor market discrimination, service work and emotional labor, unpaid household work, immigration and globalization, labor organizing, social policy, and the future of work.","1988":"Emphasis on ethnographic field work through participant observation and interviews.

W.E.B Du Bois is recognized as a pioneer of sociology of race, but his work is seldom explored. The first part of this course we discuss in-depth Du Bois work to construct the bases for a Du Boisian sociology. The second part we will read contemporary theories of race through the lens of Du Bois’ work. The final section we will read contemporary empirical works in the field of race and ethnicity, reflect how we would conduct them differently from a Du Boisian perspective.","1991":"This course introduces graduate students to the sociology of culture (understanding social influence on cultural formations) and cultural sociology (understanding cultural influences on social processes). As we consider different theoretical areas of the field, we will discuss the best methodological approaches in cultural theory. We consider how one formulates a research questions and puts evidence together in order to investigate specific instances of the culture-society interaction. We discuss the distinctions between culture, institutions and organizations.","1992":"As contestation over environmental concerns proliferates, it draws increasing attention from sociologists. But sociological research on environmental issues raises major challenges. Social-environmental relationships raise theoretical and methodological questions: How do we know an “environmental” issue when we see one? How can we effectively examine the relationships between environmental processes and social processes and structures?","1993":"Introduction to strategies sociologists use to formulate theories and conduct methodologically sound research. Hypothesis formulation and research design; special emphasis on identifying causal mechanisms, techniques of operationalization, and choice of relevant comparisons.","1994":"This course is designed for sociology graduate students whose funding has prohibited a teaching assistantship but who need to complete the departmental teaching requirement.

The instructor for this course will default as the department chair but it is the graduate student's responsibility to identify an instructor to work alongside. This partnership must be approved by the director of graduate study.","1996":"This course reviews ways in which social scientists have incorporated concepts about space, place, and distance into their theories and research. Examples are drawn from many substantive areas, including the spatial organization of communities, spatial inequalities, and mobility. Separate laboratory meetings introduce methods of spatial analysis encountered in the course readings, including an introduction to GIS and related mapping tools.","1997":"This course will review alternative theoretical perspectives on urban and regional development with an emphasis on variants of ecological and political economy approaches. Substantive topics will include metropolitan restructuring in the U.S. and abroad, growth politics and growth control, neighborhood social networks and collective action, and incorporation of immigrants and minority groups in the metropolis.","1998":"The new phase of capitalism, commonly called &quot;globalization,&quot; has radically transformed the postwar order. In this seminar, we will review several debates regarding current political-economic transformations, including: What caused the shift to neo-liberalism? What external economic pressures do states experience? Can domestic factors mediate such pressures? How do developing countries react to the new international environment? And what role does the United States and international organizations play in the new order?","1999":"Survey course of statistical methods that can be used to analyze spatial and\/or clustered data at the individual and aggregate levels.

Not a course about Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or mapping techniques.","2000":"This course is for graduate students seeking to develop their GIS skills further and to gain practice applying GIS methods in a research-oriented setting. The course is organized around a set of social science topics—as opposed to sequential coverage of various methods—and the focus is on getting from research question to analytical results to interpretation of findings. The course emphasizes practice matching concept to tool, as well as identifying appropriate tools and combining them successfully. Independent research skills using GIS are developed via the reading of published literature, the guided replication of results, and the interpretation of findings.","2001":"The goal of the course is to both engage with the many different and often conflicting theoretical paradigms in sociology that have shaped the debate on power as well as to explore in depth the various empirical manifestations of power. The goal of the course is two-fold: first to familiarize ourselves with the rich set of theoretical tools that sociology provides for exposing, engaging and reconstituting power and second to fully grapple with the challenges of producing social science research that can build on and advance the normative and empirical debate on power. Undergrads by permission of instructor.","2002":"This course provides an overview of Sociology of Education, covering substantive, theoretical, and methodological issues in the field. Beginning with classical theories of education, the course will then provide an overview of the relationship between education and society, with a focus on its role in reducing and reproducing inequality. We will discuss causes and consequences of educational inequality, paying particular attention to education and the labor market. In the process, we will engage with ascriptive forms of stratification, including race and ethnicity. The focus of the course is education in the U.S., but we will occasionally incorporate international comparisons.","2003":"This course will teach students the fundamentals of computational methods for social science research, with an emphasis on techniques for analyzing large-scale textual data. The first part of the course will provide students with basic technical skills necessary to conduct computational research, including introducing them to Python programming and web-scraping.

This course offers a history of Indian civilization from its origins up through the end of the classical period. Drawing on a rich array of textual, material, and expressive cultures, we trace the arc of human history on the subcontinent, paying special attention to the intersections of religion and politics. The sources at hand reveal the dynamic interplay between tradition and innovation, and attest to human efforts to redefine what it means to live a life according to dharma.","2007":"From LSD to magic mushrooms, mescaline to ayahuasca, psychedelics are drugs that alter consciousness and perceptions of reality. This course investigates the central role that religion and spirituality have played in the long, tangled history of psychedelics, from colonial eradication of psychedelics as indigenous sacraments, to psychedelic modes of expanding consciousness in 1960s counterculture; from the moral panic around these substances as a tool of mind control, to their present scientific investigation as a panacea for mental health, addiction, and self-realization. Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.","2008":"From its roots in premodern India to its current popularity worldwide, yoga has a rich a complex history. As a practice of the mind, body, and spirit, yoga has taken many forms—meditation, chanting, breath control, postures—in order to achieve a range of goals: liberation from rebirth, supernatural powers, strength, pleasure, peace, wellness. As its reputation and commodification have increased, yoga has attracted deep interest, debate, and even controversy. In this course we will study yoga from its earliest texts to its status in the modern world, addressing its historical, religious, social, and political ramifications in many different contexts.","2009":"A mantra is a syllable or formula used in ritual and meditation. Mantras are central to Indian religions—not only Hinduism, but also Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Sikhism. Some mantras are made up of words and language—usually in Sanskrit—while others are sound fragments with no semantic meaning. The sacred syllable OM, now a global symbol of Eastern spirituality, exemplifies the power and authority of mantra. What are mantras? What do they accomplish? How do they shape identities, beliefs, and practices? Engaging with sacred utterance in various media, this course explores the world of mantras in India and beyond.","2010":null,"2011":"Explores basic acting\/directing concepts from a variety of perspectives including the use of the actor's imagination\/impulsivity in the creation of truthful, dramatic performance; the body, as a way of knowing and communicating knowledge; and the voice, as a means of discovering and revealing emotion\/thought.
