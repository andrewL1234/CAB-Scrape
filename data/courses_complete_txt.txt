AFRI 0140 - First Lady of the Struggle:  Mary McLeod Bethune and Global Black Freedom
Course Description: This course will focus on the life and legacy of Mary McLeod Bethune through an examination of her activism in the areas of education, politics, women's rights issues, civil rights issues, and world affairs. Throughout the course of her 79 years, she rose from humble beginnings in South Carolina, the daughter of formerly enslaved parents, to work with presidents and world leaders. She was born during the period of Reconstruction, and passed away the same year as the ruling of Brown vs. Board of Education was made, which will allow for a study of her participation in laying the foundation for the Modern Civil Rights Movement. Students will also gain experiential learning by visiting historic sites which preserve the legacy of Bethune, including the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House-National Historic Site and the Carter G. Woodson Home-National Historic Site.

AFRI 0670 - Global Black Radicalism
Course Description: The decade from the mid-Sixties until the mid-Seventies witnessed the rise of Black Radicalism as a global phenomenon. The emergence of Black Power in the US, Brazil and the Caribbean, the consolidation of liberation struggles in Portuguese Africa and the rise of a Black Consciousness trend in Apartheid South Africa all represent key moments. What led young activists to embrace “Black Power?” What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa? What events in the Caribbean gave ascendancy to radical tendencies? And what forces contributed to the decline of these movements? This course seeks to answer these questions.

AFRI 1099 - Alternative Technofutures: Black Speculative Visioning for a Better Tomorrow
Course Description: In the last decade, we have witnessed the acceleration of technological experimentation and production. As such, this class explores the role that Black speculation plays in helping us envision and create technocultures beyond empire. Together, we will explore imperialism and colonialism as they manifest in our digital age, paying particular attention to how digital technologies like predictive algorithms, machine learning, surveillance, and data extraction extend and innovate on these systems of power. After initial grounding in the study of technology, speculative art and literature, and speculative design, we will pivot to “labs” where you will be able to read and analyze Black speculative works, develop a Black speculative method based on these works, and apply that method to your design of a technological tool that addresses a social problem.

AFRI 2015 - Revolt and Revolution in the Black World
Course Description: From 18th Century slave revolts to the iconic Haitian Revolution, the Grenadian Revolution of 1979 and the 2019 popular uprisings in the Sudan, revolts and revolutions have undoubtedly occupied a hallowed place in the political imaginaries of the Black World. Reading narratives from a select group of instances, we will explore, against the broader theoretical work on global revolutions, the more specific meaning of revolution in Africana history and literature. The overriding question is, in the face of disappointing outcomes, tragedy and collapse, can the history of Black revolt and revolution still provide a framework for thinking about radical change in the 21st Century, or should we move beyond it?

AFRI 2303 - Black Feminism and the Politics of Care
Course Description: “caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare” (Audre Lorde) This course focuses on Black feminist thought through the lens of care as both theory and lived experience from the late twentieth century to the present. Care in the context of the course is a radical epistemology and praxis that might be defined as, in the words of Aisha K. Finch “to be about the business of living with people, sharing in and amplifying their life force, recognizing their value and worth.” Through the critical examination of a number of texts, the course will examine the multifaceted concept and practice of care in Black people’s lives as a contest against state power and a means of survival and joy.

AMST 0192S - Producing the Body: The Body as Performance of Power, Violence, and Possibility
Course Description: What is the relationship between bodies, violence, and liberation? When Black and brown bodies have historically been sites of colonial and gendered violence, what does it mean to center the body as a site of knowledge production? This course draws upon the emergent performance and aesthetic practices as disruptions of colonial violence; and their relationship to racialized, gendered, and sexual power dynamics. This course will deeply consider what it means to be (in)human, erotic reconfigurations of being, and fugitive practice. We will draw from frameworks in performance studies, Black feminism, women of color feminism, and queer theory to understand the body as a living archive of memory, violence, and liberation. Such attention to performance and aesthetic practices entail not only histories of conquest and genocide, but the creative and life-bearing practices that transcend these conditions of captivity and loss.

AMST 0610A - Black Queer Life
Course Description: This course explores how Black writers and artists represent and theorize a diverse array of Black genders and sexualities. We will begin with a series of conversations on the origins of Black queer theory, and then use these conversations to anchor us in our readings of Black queer life in literary and popular culture. Reading across a range of genres, including film, music, poetry, comics, and short fiction, we will collectively consider the ways sex, gender, and sexuality work with other markers of difference and social status such as race, class, ability, and nationality to demarcate possibilities, freedoms, choices, and opportunities available to Black people. We will learn from theorists, writers, and artists including Audre Lorde, Cathy Cohen, E. Patrick Johnson, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Danez Smith, Janelle Monae, among many others.

AMST 1700P - Making Music American: Critical Heritage Studies
Course Description: This seminar offers a critical and comparative exploration of American music genres that operate as "heritage music" or "ethnic music" in the context of American multiculturalism. We will collectively investigate how musical practice and related discourse can construct, express, perpetuate, and sometimes challenge various cultural identities, community affiliations, and political ideologies. We will particularly attend to public performance contexts, including music festivals, club dancefloors, and live-streaming/archived online performances. Case studies focus on rural Southern "folk" genres, Chicago blues and house, Asian American taiko ensembles, and norteño/tejano dance musics (from huapango to Selena). Readings draw on historical and ethnographic scholarship grounded in critical heritage studies and critical race theory. Limited to junior-year American Studies and Ethnic Studies concentrators.

AMST 1904K - Power + Water: Material Culture and its Environmental Impact
Course Description: Students explore material culture, its impact upon the environment in the US prior to Industrial Revolution and examine the relationship of this earlier production to current issues of pollution and climate change. In the 18-19th centuries, houses, furniture, whale products were staples of American craft and ingenuity. This material culture tells the story of how gathering raw materials and converting them into usable products came at a severe cost to watersheds, forests, species, humans. These examples show that the seemingly insatiable human urge to control/transform resources into items for consumption leads to serious consequences for the earth’s climate and inhabitants.

AMST 1920A - Contemporary Narratives of US Slavery
Course Description: The antebellum African American slave narrative inaugurated Black self-representation in print. Characterized by scholars as neo-slave narratives and, later, post-neo slave narratives, contemporary fictions of US slavery deploy the formal features and thematic concerns of the slave narrative to reveal Black freedom dreams of later periods. Examining recent literary, filmic, and televisual representations of US slavery, this course foregrounds racial slavery in the establishment of longstanding socioeconomic and political asymmetries across race, gender, and class in the US. And it analyzes the ways in which imaginative depictions of racial slavery seek to address and ameliorate such asymmetries. Our class will pay particular attention to how contemporary Black writers and filmmakers thematize labor, love, gender, power, pleasure, community, and resistance among the enslaved and their descendants.

AMST 2221B - Immigration and the Borders of US Empire
Course Description: Since the founding of the United States, we have debated and struggled over the boundaries of American nationhood, who may claim the rights and protections provided by the state, and where the lines of inclusion/exclusion are drawn. This course will focus on two interrelated themes. The first is the implementation of immigration and nationality controls designed to manage cross-border traffic and restrict membership in the national community. The second is to explore how the projection of US power beyond its territorial borders (e.g. US empire) has fueled cross-border movement between metropole and colonial/postcolonial zones. We will highlight the ways in which the US’s encroachment of borders outside its territorial domain raises important questions about the meaning and legitimacy of national sovereignty and the fashioning of immigrant “illegality.”

ANTH 0066J - So You Want to Change the World?
Course Description: Examines from an anthropological perspective efforts to address global poverty that are typically labeled as "development." The enterprise of development is considered critically, both with regard to the intentions and purposes that underlie the actions of wealthy countries, donor organizations, and expatriate development workers and with regard to the outcomes for the people who are the intended beneficiaries. Privileging the prespectives of ordinary people in developing countries, but also looking carefully at the institutions involved in development, the course relies heavily on ethnographic case studies that will draw students into the complexity of one of the greatest contemporary global problems: social inequality. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students.

ANTH 0350 - Suffering and Compassion
Course Description: One might say that to be human is to suffer, but what is suffering? Is it to be avoided or embraced? To what ends? The answers to these questions are not just personal or psychological. Rather, they are deeply sociocultural and historical. Orientations toward suffering shape major aspects of life, such as religion, politics, humanitarianism, and medicine. This course explores different ways that society and culture create suffering, and ways that suffering shapes society and culture. This happens not just in suffering itself but also in ways that people try to overcome suffering. Therefore, we also consider the relationship of compassion, empathy and sympathy, and other forms of care to suffering, always paying close attention to questions of the unequal distributions of both suffering and compassion to different groups of people.

ANTH 0800 - Sound and Symbols: Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology
Course Description: This introduction to the study of language and culture considers how language not only reflects social reality but also creates it. We'll examine specific cases of broad current relevance, in the process learning how an analytical anthropological approach to language use lays bare its often hidden power. We'll consider how language creates and reinforces social inequality and difference, how language promotes and resists globalization, and how language is used creatively in performance, literature, film, advertising, and mass media. We will also consider how language does important social work in specific contexts, such as classrooms, courtrooms, medical settings, and political campaigns.

ANTH 0810 - Whiteness and Language
Course Description: How has whiteness shaped language—not specific languages or sub-varieties of languages, but the very idea of language itself? This class will not presume either whiteness or language as stable or self-evident categories. Instead, we will explore how both have emerged together in and through projects of (racial, ethnic, gendered, sexual, classed, religious, etc.) colonial modernity. The class will introduce students to a critical interdisciplinary toolkit that they will collaboratively apply to a selection of case studies drawn from global colonial situations, culminating in an original mini-research project.

ANTH 0850 - Language, Oppression, and Empowerment
Course Description: Language is a site of struggle. What we say, how we say it, and to whom matters. How we hear matters. It can make the difference between life and death. When you hear the news or a teacher talking, do you feel directly addressed? Do you feel like you are a “they” in your classes and in popular discourse? We feel when we are being talked to, talked with, or talked about, and that makes a difference in how we relate to ourselves and each other. In this class, we talk together. We make language and we make space. This class is an experiment in empowerment that comes from using reading in linguistic anthropology to analyze linguistic oppression, appropriation, and exploitation.

ANTH 1126 - Ethnographies of Heritage: Community and Landscape of the Mediterranean and Beyond
Course Description: Archaeologists study objects and (socio-cultural) anthropologists investigate culture is how stereotype and conventions have long had it. As material culture studies have increasingly blurred these boundaries, the distinction is entirely meaningless when it comes to archaeological heritage. Taking its cue from material culture studies, this course explores how local communities experience the material remains from the past and (re)incorporate them into their contemporary lives.

ANTH 1301 - Anthropology of Homelessness
Course Description: Homelessness emerged as a public concern in the United States and in other industrialized countries in the late 1970s as people began encountering people living on the streets, a way of life formerly confined to the skid rows of large cities. In this course, through readings, readings, discussion, and hands on experiences with individuals and families experiencing homelessness, we will uncover the causes, conditions, and responses to homelessness. Each student will spend at least two hours per week in a local homeless-serving community partners in order to gain face to face experiences.

ANTH 1310 - Global Health: Anthropological Perspectives
Course Description: This course explores the distinctive contribution that a critical approach—primarily that of medical anthropology—can make to the rapidly changing field of global health. The course takes a problem-based approach and focuses on “grand challenges," such as those posed by global pandemics, humanitarian crisis, or the limited reach of child and maternal health programs in “resource-poor” locations. Through ethnographic case studies, we will examine how the concepts and practices associated with global health interventions travel to different parts of the world and interact with local agendas.

ANTH 1740 - Paleoethnobotany: Ancient Agriculture to Criminal Investigations
Course Description: How can we use botanical evidence to understand the past, from cold cases to VERY cold cases? Which roles did plants play in ancient communities? What happens to plant remains after they become incorporated into the archaeological record, and what are the methods used to study these "ecofacts"? How do paleoethnobotanical interpretations contribute to our understanding of history and structure our public policy? How is botanical forensic evidence used in law enforcement investigations? This course trains students in laboratory methods and interpretations of botanical evidence through hands-on practice. We explore the major classes of plant remains likely to be encountered in forensic cases and archaeological sites; identify botanical residues and organize the data to make interpretable results; and address major issues within the discipline.

ANTH 1750 - Bioarchaeology and Forensic Anthropology
Course Description: Bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology have common methodological roots (human osteology) but are oriented to answer very different questions. Both are grounded in the anthropological sub-disciplines of biological anthropology and archaeology. The focus in bioarchaeology is advancing our understanding of the human experience in the past. Bioarchaeologists study a range of topics including health, violence, migration, and embodiment. Forensic anthropology is a form of applied anthropology that is employed to document and interpret human remains in medico-legal contexts. The course will survey both fields while instructing in the methodologies and approaches of each. The course complements The Human Skeleton ( ANTH 1720 ).

ANTH 1820 - Lost Languages: The Decipherment and Study of Ancient Writing Systems
Course Description: Humans make many marks, but it is writing that records, in tangible form, the sounds and meanings of language. Creating scripts is momentous; writing facilitates complex society and is a crucial means of cultural expression. This course addresses the nature of writing in past times. Topics include: the technology of script; its precursors and parallel notations; its emergence, use, and "death"; its change over time, especially in moments of cultural contact and colonialism; writing as a physical object or thing; code-breaking and decipherment, including scripts not yet deciphered; and the nature of non-writing or pseudo- or crypto-scripts.

ANTH 1920 - Gastronomic Heritage
Course Description: How is gastronomic heritage established and re-established through ties to ancient foodways? Where do archaeology and history contribute to the ossification and legitimation of culinary traditions and practices? There are many stakes tied to such questions—nutritional, religious, ethnic, institutional, governmental, and touristic, among others. In this course, we address relationships between food history and gastronomic heritage, drawing on examples from around the world and across media, including cookbooks, international policy reports, and video game representations. We examine culinary dimensions considered "traditional" by local communities and federal agencies, the archaeological and historical sources of such narratives (if they exist), and impacts of gastronomic heritage on modern practices, identities, and economies.

ANTH 2271 - Fiction / Ethnography (+ the space between)
Course Description: What is the relationship between fiction and ethnography, story and fact, creativity and objectivity? This course will consider how fiction and ethnography can each inform yet trouble the other, beginning from the premise that both involve a kind of magic. Using the same building blocks – seemingly humble and ostensibly available to all --writers of fiction and ethnography alike create what one contemporary author has called “language-made hallucinations, fabrications that persuade us to believe in them.” Yet these “fabrications” often have different stakes and use different methods for revealing human “truths.” We’ll explore such divergences and alignments by seeing what is provoked when juxtaposing fiction, ethnography, and even other genres of writing (poetry, journalism, creative non-fiction, etc.). Writing assignments for the course, as befits the content, are flexible with respect to genre.

ANTH 2310A - Law and Violence
Course Description: This graduate seminar draws on ethnographic studies and social theory to examine the disturbing, but not paradoxical entanglement between law and violence. Building on Charles Tilly’s comparison between state-making and organized crime and Walter Benjamin’s concepts of law-making and law-preserving violence, we will explore how different modes of violence – from brutal force to more nuanced structural and symbolic forms of oppression – intersect with policies and practices of governance. Anthropological approaches will be used to analyze questions of sovereignty, security, and justice, as we will trace their meanings across disjunctive cultural and legal terrains.

ANTH 2402 - Empire: Global Perspectives
Course Description: Empires — ancient, early modern, and contemporary — have profoundly shaped the distribution of wealth and power in the modern world. However, imperial formations are strikingly diverse, and many of the entities that scholars now call “empires” were not understood as such during their own times. This collaborative humanities graduate seminar explores that diversity and examines how empires rise, fall, and perdure. While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world. We afford particular attention to local peoples' relationships with empires, environmental history, political economy, historiography, and imperial art and material culture.

ANTH 2800 - Linguistic Theory and Practice
Course Description: An introduction to theoretical and methodological issues in the study of language and social life. We begin by examining semiotic approaches to language. We turn to classical research on language as a structured system - covering such topics as phonology and grammatical categories - but we focus on the implications of such work for broader social scientific and humanistic research. We then consider areas of active contemporary research, including cognition and linguistic relativity, meaning and semantics, pronouns and deixis, deference and register, speech acts and performativity, interaction, verbal art and poetics, reported speech, performance, and linguistic ideology.

ANTH 2801 - Whiteness and Language
Course Description: How has whiteness shaped language—not specific languages or sub-varieties of languages, but the very idea of language itself? This class will not presume either whiteness or language as stable or self-evident categories. Instead, we will explore how both have emerged together in and through projects of (racial, ethnic, gendered, sexual, classed, religious, etc.) colonial modernity. The class will introduce students to a critical interdisciplinary toolkit that they will collaboratively apply to a selection of case studies drawn from global colonial situations, culminating in an original mini-research project.

ARCH 0230 - Myriad Mediterraneans: Archaeology, Representation and Decolonization
Course Description: As debates rage about the Classical roots of Western society, the ancient Mediterranean itself is largely overlooked and continues to be seen in stereotypes. Because the ancient Mediterranean was not just white, male and colonizing, this course will explore the extensive archaeological evidence for cultural, gender, ethnic, economic and other forms of diversity during the first millennium BCE. Can archaeology contribute to current debates about decolonization? Conversely, can contemporary debates about indigenous ways of being shine a fresh light on ancient evidence?

ARCH 0528 - Living on the Edge: The Archaeology of Frontier Communities in the Roman Empire

This course explores how these communities, often marked by asymmetrical power relationships between the Roman State and local communities, developed, investigating social structures, religion, art and architecture, and economies in order to understand what it was like to live on the edge of the Roman world.

ARCH 1642 - Queering Ancient Egypt
Course Description: Queering history is a means of challenging heteronormative narratives of the past. In this course, we will critically examine the archaeological evidence for concepts such as gender, sexuality, and the body in ancient Egypt. The goal of this class is to discover what archaeology can reveal about identity formation in the past, but also to explore how modern conceptions of identity impact our writing of history. Thus, this course will address both the marginalization of gendered identities in historical research about ancient Egypt, as well as the reception of ancient identities in contemporary society.

Course Description: Archaeology is not just digging! As archaeologists have become more cautious about excavation, technological developments have transformed our ability to detect the past. We can now analyze entire settlements through the aid of drones, spy satellites, magnetometers, and ground penetrating radar. Yet such technologies come at a social and ethical cost – particularly pertaining to indigenous rights, private property, and mass surveillance. Through hands-on training, lectures, and discussion, this course explores the methods and theory behind archaeological remote sensing and geophysics, and the legal framework and ethical issues around these approaches.

ARCH 2184 - Material Culture and the Bodily Senses: Past and Present
Course Description: How do the senses shape our experience? How many senses are there? How do ancient and modern art and material culture relate to bodily senses? What is material and sensorial memory, and how does it structure time and temporality? Using media and objects, including archaeological and ethnographic collections at Brown and beyond, this course will study how a sensorial perspective on materiality can reshape and reinvigorate research dealing with past and present material culture. Furthermore, we will explore how sensoriality and affectivity can decenter the dominant western modernist canon of the autonomous individual.

ARCH 2245 - Rural Landscapes and Peasant Communities in the Mediterranean
Course Description: The aim of this course is to explore rural settlement and agrarian production in the Mediterranean, both in the ancient and the recent past. The archaeological starting-point is provided by the numerous scatters of surface remains that archaeological surveys across the Mediterranean have collected and that are usually interpreted as 'farmsteads' broadly datable to Classical Antiquity. We will look beyond these scatters to examine the social and economic significance of rural settlement through comparison with ethnographic and historical rural studies from across the Mediterranean and to explore household and community organisation and agrarian production in Classical Antiquity. Enrollment limited to 15.

ARCH 2265 - Nature and Society in the Ancient World
Course Description: What is ‘nature’? Is human society separate and distinct from the ‘natural’ world, or a closely-entwined part? Historical investigations often simplify this relationship to one-sided explanations of social or environmental determinism, missing the lived reality of people in their landscapes. This class explores the ecological reality of the ‘natural’ world in Antiquity, using archaeological, historical, and palaeo-environmental data to investigate these questions, focusing especially on the Roman and late-Roman periods.

ASYR 1050 - Brotherhood of Kings: A History of the Ancient Middle East’s First International Age, 2000-1200 BCE
Course Description: What did international politics look like in the Middle East c. 2000-1200 BCE, long before the succession of empires and states of the ancient, medieval, and modern periods? Well over a thousand years before the Persian Empire, Hammurabi of Babylon engaged in a project of statecraft that reshaped the political landscape of ancient Iraq, and the fall of Babylon a few generations later presaged an expansive international age that reached from north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean across Iraq and into Iran. Using evidence from archaeology as well as texts in translation (letters, treaties, royal propaganda, chronicles), we will explore both what happened in the ancient Middle East and how modern scholars piece together histories of the forgotten past. Topics include: statecraft and territory; diplomacy; war and peace; ancient ethnicities; modes of communication; state and society. No prerequisites.

BIOL 0220 - Discovering Novel Protein Folding Phenotypes of Wild Yeast
Course Description: Yeast species have been used by humans for over millennia in food and drink preparation. However, they are also a powerful model system to tease out the genetic and molecular details of protein folding. Research labs utilize yeast as a model system to study several cellular mechanisms, but this entire body of work comes from just two different yeast strains. And yet, wild yeast grow everywhere in our everyday environments outside of the research lab; nature has provided rich genetic diversity among these yeast species that go unstudied in a research setting. In this COEX course, you will investigate novel protein-folding phenotypes in these unidentified wild yeast strains.

BIOL 2350 - The Biology of Aging
Course Description: Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of "geroscience" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800.

CLAS 0210S - The Age of Augustus
Course Description: The Age of Augustus (44 BCE – 14 CE) was a turning point for ancient Roman politics, art, literature, and religion. In this class, intended to be accessible to those with no background in ancient studies or ancient languages as well as to those with some prior knowledge, we will consider both the political changes that allowed one man to consolidate power and turn Rome from a republic to an empire and the cultural shifts that were taking place at the same time. The course is split equally between history and art/literature/culture. We will read Virgil’s Aeneid and other major works of Latin literature in translation, consider some of the most canonical works of ancient art and architecture, and place both in the context of broader Roman culture and lived experience. How were the political and cultural changes connected?

CLAS 0765 - Witches and Vixens: Nasty Women in Ancient Greece and Rome
Course Description: What do video vixens and Foxy Brown have in common with "Witchy Woman"? These modern metaphors continue a long history of equating female sexual allure with dangers found in/or capable of subverting Nature. This course will use contemporary methodologies to make sense of similar descriptions of women found in Greco-Roman literature: how do the Greeks and Romans express a concern about gender, ethnicity, class, and/or politics using these metaphors? How do these same categories help distinguish what is "natural" from "unnatural"? To what end does this discourse about women and nature affect law, public space, or other aspects of "civilization"?

CLAS 0900 - Greek Mythology
Course Description: What is a story? Does it have a life of its own? In this class, we will explore the ancient Greek stories (or “myths”) of creation, Pandora, the Golden Fleece, Hercules, the Trojan War, the Greek goddesses and gods, and many, many more. But we will also think about the telling of these myths. What do the tellers need from these stories? How do they change the stories to fit their contexts? And is it possible to separate the “myth” from any particular telling of it? No prerequisites required; all texts in translation.

CLAS 0920 - Roman Mythology
Course Description: Introduction to Ancient Roman mythological traditions. Far from simply assimilating Greek myths and changing the names of divinities and heroes, the Romans were highly creative in their adaptation of myths from various other cultures. They had a rich store of myths and legends of their own, including dual foundation stories for Rome itself (Aeneas and the Trojans; Romulus and Remus) as well as mytho-historic tales of exemplary heroes and heroines (e.g. Horatius and Lucretia) whose exploits provided models for future Roman generations. Even obviously flesh-and-blood persons (e.g. Regulus, Hannibal, Caesar, Cleopatra) take on mythical status. We'll focus on the ancient material - literature, art, architecture, religious rituals - with a look as well at the rich reception of Roman mythology in later literature and art. We'll consider also the way the Romans themselves understood – and manipulated – their myths.

CLAS 1210 - Mediterranean Culture Wars: Archaic Greek History, c. 1200 to 479 BC
Course Description: From the end of the Bronze Age to the end of the Persian Wars is a period of considerable change in the Mediterranean and beyond. The Greek polis challenges the powers of the ancient Near East. Over seven centuries we meet Greek writing, Homeric epic, and the first historian (Herodotus). But the Greek world lay on the edges of the Ancient Near East and this course tries to offer a more balanced approach than the typically Hellenocentric perspective of the standard textbooks. CLAS 1210 addresses cultural, political, social, and economic histories. Literary, epigraphical and archaeological cultures provide the evidence. There are no written exams for this course. No previous knowledge of the ancient world is required.

CLPS 1196 - Sleep, Circadian Rhythms, and Behavioral Health
Course Description: The goal of this course is to engage in an in-depth study of sleep from the context of a specific topic (to be determined). An upper-level seminar, the course is strengthened by discussion and student-led exploration of the topic. Because of the extensive core knowledge base required to begin exploring the area in depth, the class starts with lectures and readings providing an overview of background material, including definitions/vocabulary, measurement, neural systems, regulatory processes, and typical experimental paradigms and measures. As the semester progresses, students will pick specific components of the topic for leading seminar sessions/discussions and preparing a final paper. CLPS 0010 and NEUR 0010 are recommended but not required.

CLPS 1280B - Special Topics in Cognition: Collective Cognition
Course Description: As individuals, we know little. We overestimate our knowledge of common objects and political policies, and the depth of our arguments. But humanity has achieved great things using its mental powers. The most likely reason is that we live in a community of knowledge, guided by shared intentionality. Communities understand how things work, and individuals fail to distinguish what they know from the knowledge that resides in other people's heads. In this course, we will evaluate these claims and discuss how they constrain theorizing in cognitive science. We will draw from literatures in psychology, philosophy, and computer science.

CLPS 1480H - Disorders of Memory
Course Description: In his 1882 treatise on Diseases of Memory, Ribot wrote that “the disorders and maladies of this faculty, when classified and properly understood, are no longer to be regarded as a collection of amusing anecdotes of only passing interest. They will be found to be regulated by certain laws which constitute the very basis of memory and from which its mechanism is easily laid bare.” In that spirit, this seminar will examine how both organic (e.g., Korsakoff syndrome, herpes encephalitis, semantic dementia) and functional (e.g., fugue, posthypnotic amnesia, multiple personality disorder) amnesias can inform our understanding of human memory.

CLPS 1480I - Memory, Space, and the Hippocampus
Course Description: Although the hippocampus is one of the most studied brain structures of the last century, there is still considerable disagreement about its core function. In one view, the hippocampus is essential for forming memories of the unique episodes in our lives. In another, the hippocampus is devoted to spatial navigation, encoding a spatial map of the world and our location in it. Reconciling these viewpoints has posed a significant scientific challenge. This seminar examines differing perspectives on how the hippocampus contributes to cognition and behavior, with the goal of integrating evidence from multiple subfields of psychology and neuroscience.

CLPS 1540 - Perceiving and Acting in 3D
Course Description: How does visual stimulation inform the brain about the three-dimensional structure of the world? What information is important for complex organisms, like humans and other primates, to be able to successfully interact with the surrounding environment? In this course we will examine how different sources of visual information such as stereo, contours, texture gradients, shading, and optic flow contribute to the vivid experience of 3D shape by the human visual system. Moreover, connections will be made to the mechanisms that govern goal directed actions, in order to unveil the commonalities between 3D processing for conscious perception and visuomotor mappings.

CLPS 1580C - Visualizing Information
Course Description: There has been an explosion of interest in how to present information in a visual way rather than as a bunch of boring numbers. Visualizations can be outstanding at conveying information, but there have also been colossal failures. We will explore the good, the bad, and the ugly and harness knowledge of visual perception to understand why some are more successful than others. Someone interested in how to create effective visual displays (posters, infographics) would benefit from this course. Some background in visual perception is recommended such as a CLPS or NEUR course about vision or familiarity with graphic design.

CLPS 1680H - The Developmental Origins of Cooperation
Course Description: Cooperation is essential to a thriving and functioning society. Our everyday lives contain examples of strangers making sacrifices for the benefits of others. For instance, humans donate money, blood, or even a kidney to complete strangers in times of need. That being said, it is hard to ignore that many of the problems we face as a society, such as climate change, remain intractable in part because of individuals' lack of willingness to incur monetary costs to benefit others. This class will explore the ways in which humans are and are not cooperative beings. We will do this through a developmental lens with an emphasis on understanding how cooperative impulses can be traced to behaviors in childhood.

CLPS 1730 - Psychology in Business and Economics
Course Description: The goal of this course is to explore emerging themes at the intersection of psychological science, business, and behavioral economics. Psychologists are primarily interested in detecting limits to human rationality, whereas economics tends to proceed within the rational-actor model. In business, questions arise of how theoretical models and empirical findings related to the practice of managerial decision-making. Investigations of power and the psychological impact of money are relatively recent additions to the suite of research topics. New methodologies, such as neuro-imaging have led to advances not represented in the traditional framework of organizational psychology. Enrollment limited to 20 junior and senior Psychology and Behavioral Decision Making concentrators.

CLPS 1741 - Social Brain in Context: From Neuroeconomics to Political Polarization
Course Description: This course will provide an overview of the field of social neuroscience, and in particular how the subfields of neuroeconomics and political psychology interact. We will consider how social processes are implemented at the neural level, but also how neural mechanisms help give rise to social phenomena and cultural experiences, such as political polarization. Many believe that the large expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with social others—competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. In this course, we will review core principles, theories, and methods guiding neuroeconomics, and leverage these tools and theories to better understand our current political landscape and polarized attitudes. Overall, this course will introduce students to a multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context, through the lens of neuroeconomics,

The human mind strives to resolve the competing pressures of self-interest against the greater good. By drawing upon many disciplines including philosophy, social and affective neuroscience, abnormal psychology, law, and experimental economics, this course covers topics from 18th-century philosophy to modern-day neuroscience. We will examine 1) the philosophical and epistemological foundations of moral thought, 2) the influence of emotion and contextual framing on moral action, 3) the psychopathology of immoral choice, and 4) the underlying cognitive and neurobiological processes that guide moral decision-making. Registration for this course will be determined by the faculty on the first day of class. The final class list is determined by 1) some working knowledge in cognitive neuroscience (evidence by taking at least 1 prior class in the concentration), 2) who shows up to the first class, 3) the student's year (seniority is prioritized) and 4) when people emailed the faculty member to get on the class list.

CLPS 1770 - Stigma and Prejudice
Course Description: This seminar focuses on empirical research ranging across several topics in the psychology of prejudice, stereotyping, discrimination, and social stigma. We will read, interpret, and discuss quantitative research in social psychology (i.e., studies that contain statistics in their results) and the implications of these scholarly contributions to our knowledge of the inner workings of intergroup behavior. This includes understanding individual differences and contexts related to exhibiting prejudicial behaviors (prejudice/bias), the implications of this behavior for targets of discrimination (stigma), and contributions of each of these to how groups and group members interact with one another in society (intergroup relations).

COLT 0611D - Third World Literature and Thought 1950-1970
Course Description: This course offers an introduction to Third-Worldist thought and literature, focusing on the shifting relationship between the Soviet Union, anticolonial nationalist movements, and leftist internationalist currents during the years 1955-1973. How did literature contribute to the formation of the Third-Worldist project, and how did the Third-Worldist project inform the writing of literature? We will approach these questions by examining the role of conferences, print periodicals, and supranational organizations like the Afro-Asian Writers Association in shaping new understandings of the politicized function of literature. At the same time, we will pay close attention to the aesthetic categories and literary forms that mediated a powerful sense of solidarity between far-flung revolutionary actors.

COLT 0711R - Writing and Resistance in Indigenous America (1500–1700)
Course Description: Material extraction, forced religious conversion, and physical brutality were but a few of the oppressive acts imposed on the Indigenous populations of the Americas by Western colonialism. However, those under Iberian and British Rule—in Peru, Mexico and New England—found ways to resist and negotiate the terms of domination by adopting, and therefore adapting, European forms and norms. This class takes an interdisciplinary approach that combines historiography, literature, and art, to analyze the mechanisms of Indigenous resistance within the developing structures of colonialism: race, religion, geography, and gender. We will read a variety of texts that originate from Aztec, Inca, Algonquian, Spanish, Brazilian, and British contexts. All readings available in English, but students are welcome to read any in the original language.

COLT 0812U - Beyond Yellowness: Representations of Race and Ethnicity in East Asia
Course Description: What do race and ethnicity mean to regions outside Europe and North America? How did the perceptions of different physiological and cultural features define premodern and modern East Asia? Since when and for what reasons did some people, whom Marco Polo considered “white,” become racially Asian or yellow in literary and cinematic representations? This survey course will demystify East Asian homogeneity and discuss how various literary, cinematic, and critical works from antiquity up to the modern era present notions and issues related to race and ethnicity in the region now known as East Asia. The reading material will include excerpts from The Zuo Tradition, The Travels of Marco Polo, Bai Juyi, Min Jin Lee, Orientalism, and others. The course will be taught in English, and no prior knowledge of Asian cultures or languages is required.

COLT 0812X - Culture, Climate, and the Anthropocene’s Others
Course Description: Using the theoretical framework of the Anthropocene, this course considers a wide array of aesthetic codes—from Ovidian elegy and Shakespearean tragicomedy to zombie narrative and postcolonial ghost stories—to investigate how distinct cultural forms contest, recast, and, at times, reinstate the (often-hierarchical) boundaries between human and nature, human and animal, and human and human. Through a sampling of poetry, narrative, and film, we will explore the uneven terrain of the Anthropocene, in which the feedback loops of race, class, gender, and other forms of social difference, along with geography itself, continue to separate humans, even as evidence mounts for the inseparability of humans from the rest of the planet, including its nonhuman inhabitants. Course materials will be provided in English and include works from Ishirō Honda, Octavia Butler, Colson Whitehead, Tommy Orange, J.M. Coetzee, and Bong Joon-Ho, among others.

COLT 1021 - Literature and Photography: Writing and Thinking with Light
Course Description: "I didn't draw any people," Kafka once wrote, "I told a story. Those are pictures, only pictures...one takes photographs of things in order to forget them. My stories are a way of closing my eyes." Kafka's sentences invite us to reflect upon the relationship between literature, photography, and philosophical thought—from the first heliograph in 1826 and the inception of the daguerreotype in 1839 to the digital image of today. Taking as our point of departure the relation of literature and "light-writing," we will address selected issues in the historical and conceptual interaction among word, image, and critical thought. Our wager: texts and photographic images share a common relationship to time, desire, death, mourning, and politics. Writers may include Kafka, Proust, Benjamin, Kracauer, Barthes, Heidegger, and Derrida. Images by photographers including August Sander and Andrew Moore. Students from diverse fields welcome.

COLT 1422M - Reading the Short Story
Course Description: This course invites students to explore the pleasurable challenges of close reading within the context of a compressed form, the modern short story. Select works from the nineteenth century on wards—many of them masterpieces, some hidden gems from around the world—will help us question what we think they mean and how we know this. We will develop practices and techniques for articulating such quandaries even as we observe how sociocultural themes, theories of interpretation, and literary movements intertwine with expressions of the self and the politics of identity. No prerequisites. Open to all undergraduates.

COLT 1431J - Anti Poetry
Course Description: Hating on poetry is a time-honored tradition. From Plato to the Dadaists, thinkers and writers across the world have questioned the reigning poetics, or the value of poetry altogether. This course examines a range of theoretical arguments about the value and nature of poetry from the premodern period to the present. At the same time, we will closely read materials from literary projects that have explored the permissible limits of the poetic, defined themselves against poetry, or have been accused of failing to meet the standards of poetry. Focusing on case studies like the Latin American anti-poetry movement, the Arabic prose poem and the work of the LANGUAGE poets, we will familiarize ourselves with debates in lyric theory and a variety of poetic traditions.

COLT 1440U - The Listener (Literature, Theory, Film)
Course Description: Listening is not only the supposedly peaceful, welcoming activity that verges on mere receptive passivity. Listening or not listening also has to do with the exercise of power and this is the reason why we have a responsibility as listeners. In order to explore what could be described as the politics of listening, we will follow multiple paths that will lead us from the strategies of listening in concert venues to the medical practice of auscultation and the generalization of surveillance techniques. Our seminar will interweave readings in literature or theory (Kafka, Nietzsche, Calvino, Foucault, Chekhov, Freud, Deleuze. . .) and screenings of selected filmic scenes.

CSCI 0170 - Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction
Course Description: CSCI 0170 is a computer science introduction suitable for students with no prior experience. It focuses on functional programming, which provides a new experience for students who have already done some programming and a solid foundation for students who have never programmed at all. Students learn to design solutions to computational problems, solutions that are compact, elegant, and efficient. Over the course of the semester, the computational problems addressed grow in complexity, from simple (e.g. long addition) to moderate (e.g. implementation of one programming language in another) to sophisticated (e.g. an implementation of an AI game player for two-person games of complete information). We study clear and precise formulation of computational problems, use of recursion, and rudimentary analysis of algorithms. The emphasis is on problem solving and insight and crafting beautiful things rather than on coding.

CSCI 1650 - Software Security and Exploitation
Course Description: CSCI 1650 covers software exploitation techniques and state-of-the-art mechanisms for hardening software. The course begins with a summary of prevalent software defects, typically found in applications written in memory unsafe languages, like C/C++, and proceeds with studying traditional and modern exploitation techniques, ranging from classical code injection and code reuse up to the latest goodies (e.g., JIT-ROP). For the most part, it focuses on defenses against certain vulnerability classes and the way(s) to bypass them. Students will be introduced to advanced software exploitation techniques and countermeasures, and study (in depth) the boundaries and effectiveness of standard hardening mechanisms, such as address space randomization and stack and heap protections.

CSCI 1952B - Responsible Computer Science in Practice
Course Description: What can ethics and social and political theory tell us about how to navigate the social impacts of computing? How do these perspectives shape technical decisions computer scientists have to make? The role of computer scientists is rapidly evolving: as the systems they build affect everyone, from individuals to society at large, computer scientists become more than just coders. They must be able to assess the social impacts of the technology they develop and engage with experts from other disciplines which offer critical insights and normative perspectives on those impacts. The goal of this course is to enable you to understand and critically reflect on key concepts and ideas in ethics and social and political theory on topics ranging from fairness to consent, digital well-being to regulation, and to apply them to concrete technical decisions in practical exercises and project-oriented work.

CSCI 2952U - Beyond Worst Case Analysis of Algorithms
Course Description: The theoretical study of algorithms and data structures has focused mostly on worst-case analysis, where we prove bounds on the running time, space, approximation ratio, competitive ratio, or other measure that holds even in the worst case. More and more, however, the limitations of worst-case analysis become apparent and create new challenges. In practice, we often do not face worst-case scenarios, and the question arises of how we can tune our algorithms to work even better on the kinds of instances we are likely to see, while ideally keeping a rigorous formal framework of analysis. In this graduate seminar course, we will review several alternatives to worst-case analysis, developed largely in the theoretical computer science literature over the past 20 years, and their most notable algorithmic applications. Subjects include: parametrized analysis, instance optimality, semirandom models, smoothed analysis, comparative analysis, and

COST 0067 - Divine Drugs: Psychedelics, Religion, and Spirituality
Course Description: From LSD to magic mushrooms, mescaline to ayahuasca, psychedelics are drugs that alter consciousness and perceptions of reality. This course investigates the central role that religion and spirituality have played in the long, tangled history of psychedelics, from colonial eradication of psychedelics as indigenous sacraments, to psychedelic modes of expanding consciousness in 1960s counterculture; from the moral panic around these substances as a tool of mind control, to their present scientific investigation as a panacea for mental health, addiction, and self-realization. Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.

COST 0526 - This Whole World is OM: Mantras in Indian Religions
Course Description: A mantra is a syllable or formula used in ritual and meditation. Mantras are central to Indian religions—not only Hinduism, but also Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Sikhism. Some mantras are made up of words and language—usually in Sanskrit—while others are sound fragments with no semantic meaning. The sacred syllable OM, now a global symbol of Eastern spirituality, exemplifies the power and authority of mantra. What are mantras? What do they accomplish? How do they shape identities, beliefs, and practices? Engaging with sacred utterance in various media, this course explores the world of mantras in India and beyond.

COST 0535 - Self Transformation and Transcendence in Later Daoist Contemplative Traditions
Course Description: Who are we? How do we fit in the universe? Like many other systems of thought around the world, the Daoist tradition approached these questions both through the creation of texts, teachings, and theory, and through the development of at times extremely complex embodied contemplative practices. Starting from a perspective of a person not as a unitary, monolithic entity, but rather as a composite of energies and influences, these practices seek to harmonize, balance, and transform the person. This course will explore how the possibilities of personal transformation were expressed in Daoist contemplative literature from the first centuries CE up to the modern day. Contemplative practice labs will also offer students an opportunity to explore the ideas in the texts through direct experience. No prerequisites.

Course Description: When we casually hear about Zen it seems loosely associated with being cool or hip, like the seemingly mysterious “Sound of One Hand.” But what does “Zen” really mean and how did it come into the modern Western cultural landscape? We explore the Zen traditions of East Asia and trace their transmission to the West through a study of their writings and practices. From the arrival of Zen master Shaku Sōen Kogaku at the Parliament of World Religions in 1893, through the writings of D.T. Suzuki, to the Beat Zen of the 1950’s and the establishment of centers of Zen practice, we will help you to appreciate in your own lives what the Daily Show calls your “moments of Zen."

COST 1082 - Me, Myself, and I: Exploring Senses of Self from a Multidisciplinary Perspective
Course Description: Human beings have long puzzled over how precisely to conceptualize and understand what and how it is that we are. Questions about the nature of the self have informed the speculations of philosophy, the soteriologies of religion, the trajectories of self-cultivation in contemplative traditions, and the therapeutics of psychology. Recently, cognitive science and phenomenology have developed new explanations for how multiple senses of self shape lived experience and give rise to various self-concepts. Students in this course will engage with dimensions of selfhood that we often take for granted by studying senses of self from multidisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives.

EAST 0141 - Catastrophic Japan
Course Description: Japan is a place where catastrophic events have occurred more frequently and done more damage over the last century and a half than they have in all but a handful of other locations on the planet. This seminar examines how massive earthquakes, destructive tsunami, the firebombing of Tokyo, the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic weapons, and large-scale exposures to toxic substances and radiation have shaped Japan’s modern history. We will explore the debates over how best to mitigate the effects of “natural” and technological hazards, and analyze the role played by popular culture in shaping the meanings assigned to catastrophes past, present and future.

EAST 0309 - Courtesans, Concubines, and Wives: Gender Relations in Imperial China
Course Description: This course examines gender relations in China in the imperial period, from roughly 200 BCE down to 1911 CE. By examining the categories of courtesan (entertainers), concubines (secondary consorts), and wives, we will see how the Chinese gender system evolved over time. We will examine how the gender system was both shaped by other social and cultural phenomena and in turn impacted other aspects of culture and society. The course follows a roughly chronological trajectory: each section of the course will be devoted to a particular set of historical issues that was particularly salient in that period. We will examine how gender relations intersected with philosophical ideals, political agendas, religious values, and economic developments, and how individuals navigated the gender system to construct meaningful lives.

EAST 0703 - Confucianism and Its Critics
Course Description: This course confronts the changing historical phenomenon we call “Confucianism” on its own terms, as represented by its advocates, as well as from the perspective of its interlocutors and critics. It is an opportunity to become familiar not only with the Confucian canon and its main commentarial traditions, which undergirded education in East Asia into the nineteenth century, but also with the ways in which these ideas were rejected, adjusted, and reconfigured in early Daoist discussions, Neo-Confucian debates with Buddhists, and modern disputes over their socioeconomic, political, and/or gender impact. Readings are drawn from primary Chinese, Korean, and Japanese texts in translation, and from modern interpretations of Confucianism and its legacy. The course format is primarily discussion and short lecture. No prerequisites. Counts for concentration credit in East Asian Studies and Religious Studies.

ECON 1820 - Theory of Behavioral Economics
Course Description: This course provides a formal introduction to behavioral economics, focusing mostly on individual decision making. For different choice domains, we start by analyzing the behavior implied by benchmark models used by economists (e.g. rational choice, expected utility, exponential discounting). Experimental and empirical evidence is then used to highlight some limitations of these models, and to motivate new models that have been introduced to account for these violations. We will cover, for instance, models of limited attention, non-expected utility, and hyperbolic discounting.

ECON 1830 - Behavioral Finance
Course Description: Over the past several decades, the field of finance has developed a successful paradigm based on the notions that investors and managers are generally rational and that the prices of securities are generally “efficient.” In recent years, however, theoretical and empirical research has shown this paradigm to be insufficient in describing the various features of actual financial markets. In this course we will examine how the insights of behavioral finance complement the traditional paradigm and shed light on the behavior of asset prices, corporate finance, financial crises, and other phenomena.

The analysis proposes a resolution for some of the most fundamental mysteries of the journey of humanity: What trapped humankind in poverty for most of human existence? What sparked the massive metamorphosis in living standards over the past two centuries? And what led to the emergence of immense inequality across nations?

EDUC 1310 - Inside Higher Ed: Sex, Class, and Admissions
Course Description: This course introduces students to the sociological study of higher education in the United States. In this seminar, our primary focus will be to engage with the current debates, issues, and problems associated with higher education. Among the questions we will explore are: What is hook-up culture, and can you “opt-out”? What is the purpose of higher education, and how does our background impact how we answer this question? Who are the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action? Are legacy students and athletes advantaged in the admissions process? Which students are most likely to participate in class discussion? And how does gender matter for who does and does not participate? Who is best served by higher education institutions? This class is not just about reading research. You will be required to actively discuss and reflect on your collegiate experiences with your classmates.

EDUC 1765 - Education Policy and Program Evaluations in Low- and Middle-Income Countries
Course Description: While tremendous progress has been made around the world toward universal access to primary school in low- and middle-income countries, student learning and progress in secondary school remains an important challenge for many countries. In the last two decades, governments have implemented many education policies and programs incorporating evaluations using novel methods to estimate their causal impact. Findings have improved our understanding of the effect and cost-effectiveness of a wide range of programs and greatly influenced policy. This course will explore the evidence available, question the theories that motivated the programs, ethics related to evaluation, and the lessons learned. This course is a seminar and designed for students interested in international education policy and development economics. We will explore education policies around the world, but the main geographical focus will be on countries classified as low- or middle-income.

EGYT 1435 - At the Crossroads of Three Continents: Ancient Egypt’s History from the Collapse to Cleopatra
Course Description: The year is c. 1170 BCE: Egypt is already ancient, but gone are the days of building pyramids, and for hundreds of years, the Pharaohs of the New Kingdom had managed an empire stretching from Syria to Egypt following the Nile south into Sudan. Starting with the ‘Bronze Age Collapse’ and continuing through the equally seismic shifts that followed, this course examines the latter half of ancient Egyptian history. Students will learn how this ancient state constantly reinvented itself, through the rule of an elite class of priests, Kushite Pharaohs and Assyrian invaders, a Saite Renaissance and interactions with Greek colonists, Persian occupations and revolts, and the rise and fall of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Using archaeology and written sources in translation, we will explore this broad but captivating chapter of human history. No prerequisites.

ENGN 0120B - Crossing the Space Chasm Through Engineering Design
Course Description: Five decades of human activity in space have provided the world with instant global communications and positioning, human and robotic exploration of the moon, planets and sun, and a perspective of earth which informs and influences our relationship with our environment. Unlike other technical revolutions space has not transitioned to a commercial, consumer market commodity. Rather its users and applications remain primarily large and institutional. To experience the challenges of engineering design for adoption of innovation, we will work in groups to identify uses of space, and a plan for their implementations, that could help space become “every day”. Through the process of design, we will confront the technical, economic, societal and political barriers to acceptance of innovation and to making new technologies beneficial to a wider range of users. Enrollment limited to 18 first year students.

ENGN 1700 - High Reynolds Number Flows
Course Description: You will explore the fluid mechanics of aerospace and energy systems. Aerospace fluid dynamics are the dynamics of flows involving air. Such flows have a variable density over space and time. They can expand to take the shape of volume or be compressed into a confined space. These flows surround (air), inflate (air in lungs), compress (impact), hold/push (drag/thrust), and levitate (flight). Investigate flows to design and take advantage of their behavior for engineering solutions (e.g., extracting energy). Learn to identify a fluid and develop the framework (differential equations) describing compressible flow motion/dynamics. Study fundamental thin airfoil, wing, and boundary layer theory. Consider extracting energy from air flows using wind turbines. Solve the Euler equations using analysis and numerical methods. The course concludes by surveying advanced topics involving supersonics, hypersonics, and space propulsion. Prerequisites: ENGN 0720 and ENGN 0810 .

ENGN 1931W - Selling & Sales Leadership in the Entrepreneurial Environment
Course Description: Is there any skill more important to entrepreneurs than sales? Startups only have two problems: sales and all else. The entrepreneur starts with a product or service and must convince an embryonic team to join a firm before there is a product, financing or customers; and convince investors the idea is sound, doable, and profitable; and convince customers to rely on a company with no track record. Sales skills are essential. Entrepreneurs sell an intangible and must make it feel immensely tangible. Until company/product become tangible, sales responsibility never stops. Entrepreneurs are key sales figures and face of the company.

ENGN 2830 - High Reynolds Number Flows
Course Description: We explore the fluid mechanics of aerospace and energy systems in this course. Aerospace fluid dynamics are dynamics of flows involving air. Such flows have variable density over space and time. They can expand to take the shape of their volume or be compressed into an enclosing, confined space. These flows surround (air), inflate (air in lungs), compress (impact), hold/push (drag/thrust), and levitate (flight) us. We investigate flows to design and take advantage of their behavior for engineering solutions (e.g., extracting energy). You will learn to identify a fluid and develop the mathematical framework (differential equations) that describe compressible flow motion/dynamics. We study fundamental thin airfoil, wing, and boundary layer theory. We will consider extracting energy from air flows using wind turbines. We conclude by surveying advanced topics involving supersonics, hypersonics, and space propulsion.

ENGN 2910G - Topics in Translational Research and Technologies
Course Description: To improve human health, engineering and scientific discoveries must be explored in the context of application and translated into human/societal value. Translational research is creating a fundamental change in the way basic science and engineering research has operated for decades, breaking down the literal and figurative walls that separate basic scientists/engineers and clinical researchers. Such discoveries typically begin at "the bench" with basic research--and in the case of medicine--then progress to the clinical level, or the patient's "bedside." This seminar course will utilize case studies to demonstrate to students how the translational research unfolds. Lectures will be delivered by clinicians, medical researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs, with case studies focused on topics ranging from value creation, IRB, HIPAA, FDA approval, etc.

ENGN 2912U - Coordinated Mobile Robotics
Course Description: Mobile robotics has made a large impact in our lives, from how we satisfy our consumerism to how we fight wars. Thousands of warehouse robots autonomously zip around each other in a highly structured and specialized environment that makes coordination look easy, while military robots are often teleoperated by more than one person, making coordination difficult. Moving beyond highly controlled scenarios presents many challenges. Most importantly, mobile robots will interact in complex environments with other robots and people. How can we ensure robots safely do what we want them to do? What are the ethical ramifications of multirobot systems? In this course, we study the past, present, and future of coordinated mobile robotics, including a discussion of ethics. The majority of this course is a seminar-style survey of issues and approaches for control and coordination in multi-robot systems.

ENGL 0101F - American Realism
Course Description: What do we mean when we call a novel realistic? When did the term first start being used, and why? This class attempts to answer these questions by studying the emergence of realism as the dominant literary form in the late nineteenth century, reading the work of writers such as Henry James, Thomas Hardy, Stephen Crane, Edith Wharton, and Charles Chesnutt. Our aim will be to develop a working definition of realism, and to understand why it proved such an appealing genre. In the process we will touch upon some of the major intellectual and social developments of the period, such as Darwin’s theory of evolution, Freud’s theory of the unconscious, the rise of the mass media, the triumph of consumerism, mass immigration, and the system of Jim Crow segregation.

ENGL 0151G - The Middle Ages Goes to the Movies
Course Description: People just can't seem to stop turning medieval literature into movies. Why? And more importantly-- how? What is being created when Dev Patel's Gawain wanders through the fog in an oversized scarf, or when Aubrey Plaza's Sister Fernanda waves around a hand axe while screaming at the top of her lungs? In this course, we will read selected highlights from 1000 years of literary history from the European Middle Ages, watch films based (with varying degrees of looseness) on those texts, and explore what it means to adapt something. Along the way, we will learn how to read literature, how to watch movies, and how to think about adaptations beyond the limiting notion of "faithfulness." No previous knowledge of the Middle Ages necessary. Films may contain explicit content.

ENGL 0151H - Literature and the Sea
Course Description: Stories begin with the sea: Jason and the Argonauts, Sinbad and the Seven Seas, Odysseus trying to sail home. Modern narrative, in turn, finds one of its crucial settings on board ships: Ahab’s quest to kill the white whale in Moby Dick, Jim’s crisis of self in Lord Jim. This class reads these works in the context of a number of other texts set at sea, the place of ‘tall tales,’ of adventure, sometimes of terror, but also of industrial labor, modern commerce, and racial conflict. Our aim will be to explore how fiction works both on the level of individual sentences and paragraphs and on the level of narrative, character, and plot.

ENGL 0202B - What Monks Want: Asceticism and Austerity Across the Global Anglophone
Course Description: Today, the word “austerity” is strongly associated with harsh economic policies that force people to live with less. But what if a person voluntarily embraces an austere lifestyle? In this course, we will consider the figure of the ascetic—an individual who leads a life of severe self-discipline and restraint—across an expansive range of literature from the Global Anglophone, such as Frankenstein, In the Castle of My Skin, Nervous Conditions, The Inheritance of Loss, and Normal People. Why would an individual place such demanding restrictions on their everyday life, and what new perspectives could the extremities of asceticism provide on our own lives?

ENGL 0202C - Experiments in Asian and Asian Diaspora Literature and Culture
Course Description: This course introduces students to textual, visual, and filmic experiments by Asian and Asian diaspora writers and artists. Instead of reading memoirs and realist novels, we will consider how these artists explore forms like short stories, performance, graphic novels, and films, as well as genres like science fiction, horror, mystery, and romance. This course’s focus on speculative and unsettling forms of storytelling will expand our understanding of Asian and Asian diaspora artistry and recast themes of immigration, alienation, belonging, grief, memory, and identity. “What if?” is an important question these storytellers ask; “What if" is a type of creativity we will investigate by close reading these recent experiments at the limits of storytelling. Texts include short and feature-length films and fiction by Haruki Murakami, Karen Tei Yamashita, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ling Ma, and Charles Yu. No prerequisites.

Course Description: What cause do we have to remember? How humans engage with and conceive of the past has been the focus of philosophical and literary study for thousands of years. Whether conceptualized as a form of identity formation, a source of motivation, or an opportunity for reconciliation, memory is deeply integrated into how we think.

ENGL 0310Q - Why Before 1700?  Literature before Literature
Course Description: Why does the English department require concentrators to take one course covering writing before the year 1700? What's so magical about 1700? What's so special about literature before that date? The word “literature” in its modern sense doesn’t even emerge until the 18th century (at the earliest). So is what we’re reading when we read pre-1700 material even literature? We'll survey some writing produced--wait for it--before 1700, consider why we're doing so and whether such a requirement makes sense, and read some material about the function and value of the study of literature in English in the first place. Authors may include William Shakespeare, Anne Bradstreet, John Milton, and Aphra Behn.

ENGL 0800T - Introduction to Black Literary Theory
Course Description: This course will explore key theoretical moves in black literary studies since about 1970. The intent is to think historically and conceptually about the field of black literary studies by exploiting and refusing the distinctions between “theory” and “blackness.” Our work might include studying the following areas: archive, pessimism, feminism, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, phenomenology, affect/new materialism, queer, disability, performance. In sum, this course is a chance to consider blackness as a point of departure for literary study, and perhaps the reverse—literary study as an engagement with thinking conceptually about blackness.

ENGL 1711T - 1984: The Myth and the Moment
Course Description: Since George Orwell’s 1949 publication of Nineteen Eight-Four, the year 1984 has loomed large in our imagination. We delve into this year as both an idea and a watershed moment. Historically, it was the year of the Space Shuttle Discovery’s maiden voyage; ongoing famine in Ethiopia; the continuing Cold War; the Macintosh computer; and the shooting of four African-American teenagers on the New York subway. Culturally, 1984 brought us Ghostbusters and The Terminator; Louise Erdrich’s Love Medicine and Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being; Prince's Purple Rain; the creation of Tetris; and the rise of the infomercial. By focusing on a single year, we consider how culture and politics intertwine in an unfolding history, and how myths animate lived experience. Works by Erdrich, Kundera, John Edgar Wideman, Jayne Anne Phillips, Martin Amis, in addition to film, television, and music.

ENGL 1762J - Books Behind Bars: African American Literature's Response to Mass Incarceration
Course Description: Many scholars have noted—perhaps most famously Angela Davis—the rise of the prison industrial complex over the latter half of the 20th century, which disproportionately undermined the freedom dreams of Black Americans after the victories of the civil rights movement. This class will address the various methods and forms contemporary Black writers have used to discuss this ever-looming injustice that hangs over Black American life: how it impacts family structures and marriages and has altered various roles—including gender roles—within the Black community.

ENGL 1762P - Lucille Clifton
Course Description: Across thirteen collections published between 1969 and 2008, Lucille Clifton established herself as an essential American lyricist. This course is interested in Clifton’s poetics as philosophical thinking, in her investigation of what being human is (ontology), how the human is to be (ethics), what knowing is (epistemology). We will study Clifton’s engagement with the theological—especially of the Edenic—as a praxis for exploring trauma, language, time, and the beginning of the world. Most centrally, we will consider Clifton’s deployment of brevity, of vernacular or everyday language, as a philosophical and aesthetic enactment of ordinariness.

ENGL 1762Q - Apartheid and the Literary Imagination
Course Description: South Africa has had a distinctive and tumultuous history: pre-colonial inter-ethnic dynamics; European settlement and rivalry played out on African soil; and, between 1948 and 1994, the policy of state racism called apartheid. In this seminar, we study fiction by South African writers who used the English language. The writers address moral and aesthetic questions occasioned by the challenge of trafficking in imaginative literature in a South Africa governed by repressive regimes of white supremacy. At the level of form, they do so in diverse ways. Issues that will engage us include debates around such literary-critical concepts as: protest, realism, modernism, and the “post-apartheid” in literature. Works by Brutus, Coetzee, Fugard, Gordimer, La Guma, Mda, Ndebele, Paton, Plaatje, and Wicomb. We will also discuss some poetry and the films Cry, the Beloved Country (1951; 1995), and Tsotsi (2005).

ENGL 1901R - The Problem of Literary Study
Course Description: Studying literature presents far more problems than answers. In the first place, what counts as “literature,” and why does it need–or does it?--to be studied? Should we study a literary work as an entity unto itself, or does context play such a crucial role in the generation of meaning that we mustn’t ignore it? Or is it somehow necessary to treat a work of literature as both entirely independent and completely saturated with its cultural moment? We’ll explore these and many other problems inherent to the study of what is called literature. Authors may include Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and others.

ENGL 1901T - Practices of Autofiction
Course Description: One of the more sensational developments in contemporary literature in the United States is the emergence of so-called “autofiction,” an abbreviation of the term “autobiographical fiction.” But what is distinctive about this literary form, if anything, and what is behind its current popularity? Does it, as one prominent theorist has proposed, denote “a new craving for reality in contemporary literature,” or is its significance on the contrary, in the words of another critic, that it “neatly and economically poses the question of the self as fiction”? This course will survey a range of “autofictional” practices in literature, art, and film, and consider several explanations for this wave of interest. Authors include Knausgaard, E. Hardwick, G. Murnane, Teju Cole, Sophie Calle, J. Panahi, Paul B. Preciado, A. Ernaux, F. Jameson, T. Moi, A. Kim.

ENGL 2901S - Late Formalism
Course Description: Late Style has long been a topic of critical reflection, whether to describe the trajectory of an individual artist’s career or the ultimate achievement of a philosophical corpus. We also attach late and other markers of temporality, development or discontinuity, (im)maturity or belatedness, to broader intellectual movements and historical periods: Late Beethoven, Early Marx and Late Capital, or the New Criticism, the New(er) Historicism, post-modernism and the new eighteenth century. As this potentially interminable catalogue suggests, the late is not invariably attached to notions of mastery or wisdom, ripeness or completion, as the signifier of a desired end. In Late Style, Edward Said aligned lateness with "intransigence and unresolved contradiction," indeed, with a kind of failure. This course examines the vicissitudes of the literary formalisms of the last century: have they reached a “late” moment, an intransigent but generative impasse?

ENVS 0715 - Political Ecology
Course Description: Political ecology asks how power mediates human-environment relationships. How do we, as society, understand “the environment,” environmental problems, our role in them, and potential solutions? How have human-environment interactions reproduced inequity related to class, race, gender, and worldview; how does inequity, in turn, relate to environmental realities? Whose environmental “truth” counts, whose doesn’t, and why? Are better futures possible (and who defines “better futures”)? In this course, we will consider these questions and more. We will examine how knowledge production and socio-economic structures and processes relate to environmental change across economic, political, social, and ecological contexts. The first part of the course will introduce political ecology’s roots and major arguments. We will use this foundation to analyze real-world cases and consider the opportunities, or “openings,” for different environmental futures.

ENVS 1232 - Land Matters: Stewardship, Sovereignty, and Justice on the Ground
Course Description: We are connected to Land. Whether our connection is intimate and acknowledged or distant and unexplored, human (and other) lives are rooted in Land. In this course, we draw out matters of land, asking how and for whom land matters. Building on scholarship, journalism, public commentary, movements, podcasts, and videos, we explore land as a multifaceted and fundamental source of life, knowledge, community, wealth, power, theft, exclusion, sovereignty, justice, and healing. The course is grounded in US-based land histories and how colonial violence, patriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalism intersect to shape land access, control, and ownership. From this foundation, we explore on-the-ground efforts toward land justice, including decolonization, reparations, agrarian commons, and land trusts. Students will leave the course with frameworks for envisioning and helping to build equitable, just, and healthy Land futures based in stewardship, intention, and care.

ENVS 1554 - Farm Planet: Hunger, Development, and the Future of Food and Agriculture
Course Description: Hunger amidst plenty is an enduringly wicked problem. Modern agriculture has become incredibly productive, fueling the global grain trade, the meatification of human diets, and the exponential expansion of food and non-food products. Still, the number of people who are hungry, food insecure, and/or malnourished is stable or increasing in various parts of the world. As global population rises, calls to further increase and intensify agricultural production ring out across the globe. Through (agro-)ecological, feminist, and justice lenses, we will explore the political economy of food insecurity and agriculture, the political ecology of agricultural development, and critical humanist approaches to the past, present, and future of farming. We will connect with human geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, historians, Indigenous scholars, Black Studies scholars, feminists, and people working outside of academia.

ENVS 1615 - Climate Change, Human Rights, and the Policy Process
Course Description: The diminishing quality of Earth’s systems and resources carries profound implications for the fulfillment of human rights and aspirations. But even as Western knowledge systems understand better the intrinsic interdependencies between humans and the non-human, policy gridlock persists. Indeed, scientific findings are regularly contested on political grounds. The purpose of this course is to learn how to apply diverse knowledges from Indigenous to Modern to map the relevant policy in problems at the intersection of human rights and environmental integrity, and to develop approaches to address them in ways that are creative, effective, responsible and just.

ENVS 1805 - Ocean Governance and Policy
Course Description: This course offers a deep dive into ocean and coastal governance and policy. As residents of the Ocean State, how well do we understand how society interacts with ocean spaces and resources, from local to national and global scales? We will investigate how marine policy planning and implementation processes interact with particular political, social, and economic contexts through case study examples, local practitioner guest speakers, and in-class debates. Using a variety of marine policy sectors (e.g., fisheries, energy, and biodiversity management), we will critically evaluate management tools (e.g., market mechanisms, regulations, area-based management, and community-based management). We will unsettle “established” policy assumptions, asking: Who governs oceans? How does power relate to ocean policy creation and outcomes? What are the roles of science, knowledge, institutions, history, and context in how ocean governance plays out on the ground (or in the waves!)?

ENVS 1820 - China’s Environmental History: Sources and Themes
Course Description: As one of the world’s great civilizations, China has an unparalleled written record of how people have transformed their environments over 3000 years. This seminar will explore China’s environmental history from early times to the present by focusing on the words of people in China, which we will read in translation. China’s prosperity was historically based on millions of people producing food and other materials from the land, often replacing natural ecosystems with farms, tree plantations and other human ecosystems. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 this has been combined with intensive government development projects and highly polluting industrialization. We will read a wide variety of translated sources to understand this history, including landscape poetry, medical manuals, travel narratives, geographies, laws, Buddhist texts, recipe books, and even science fiction.

ENVS 1823 - Climate Media, Discourse, and Power
Course Description: How does the American public think about and talk about climate change, and how are these discussions shaped by the interventions of powerful interest groups and political elites? In this course, we will consider how individuals’ understandings of climate change are deeply shaped by relations of power, from corporate strategies to delay meaningful action on climate change, to the norms and operations of media institutions, to dominant environmentalist discourses that fail to engage larger socioeconomic structures. While we will primarily discuss how public understanding has historically been constrained by the operation of power, we consider throughout possibilities for crafting climate narratives that resist these limitations to pursue transformative change. This course will focus primarily on climate politics in the United States, but we will also consider other national contexts and impacts on communities across the globe.

ENVS 1825 - Commodity Natures: Supply Chains From Extraction to Waste and Alternatives to Endless Growth
Course Description: What goes into the things we use everyday? Who makes commodities and under what conditions? What happens to stuff after we throw it away? Are we stuck with mass consumption? Are there workable alternatives? These are the kinds of questions we will unpack. Reading from commodity and discard studies, and political economy and ecology, we will situate economic growth in social and environmental context. We will look at production, extraction, circulation, disposal, and afterlives of commodities, with particular attention to invisibilized labor and environmental externalities. And we will explore sustainability proposals, including circularity, degrowth, and repair. In addition to an individual paper, you will apply analytical tools in a semester-long research project to examine a commodity of your choosing. With peers, you will produce a report, narrative website, video, or web-series to narrate the life and afterlife of your thing.

ETHN 0090C - Latinx Art
Course Description: This in-person, discussion-based seminar serves as an introduction to contemporary US Latinx Art. How do we understand the category “Latinx Art” and its history? How have the expressive iterations of different communities reflected on community dynamics and politics? How do contemporary curatorial projects provide platforms to envision Latinx futures? Departing from the cultural expressions linked to US Latinx civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s, this class will dwell on diverse formal and thematic approaches and foci in contemporary US Latinx Art to reflect more broadly on the ideological impact of expressive culture. We will do so by studying the expressive culture of artists in the United States of Latin American descent as well as the interdisciplinary critical scholarship of art history and visual culture scholars. Attendance to relevant local exhibitions and artist talks will be encouraged.

Topics include orientalism in U.S. culture, immigration and exclusion, Asian American civil rights struggles, and the “model minority.” We eschew any claim that an “authentic” or “typical” Asian American experience exists, instead working from the idea that Asian Americans and their lives are multifaceted, complex, and dynamic. Course materials will include primary and secondary sources and incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship and approaches while being anchored in history.

ETHN 1200B - Contemporary Indigenous Education in North America
Course Description: In the past, formalized schooling in Indigenous communities was a tool of colonization and cultural genocide, forcing Native peoples to assimilate to western norms, values, and knowledge. However, contemporary Indigenous communities have managed to reclaim and reshape education for Native youth, utilizing innovative methods and technologies, as well as drawing upon generations of traditional and indigenous knowledges to create environments that promote academic achievement alongside culture. In this course we will focus on the ways Native communities are asserting their educational sovereignty, through culturally-relevant/responsive curriculums, language immersion schools, indigenous charter schools, traditional ecological and scientific knowledges, and more.

FREN 0720D - Contes et identités francophones
Course Description: Folktales are fantastical stories, but they are also connected to social realities in profound and surprising ways. In this course we will explore what folktales and their adaptations in literature and film have to tell us about the cultures in which they are (re)told. Focusing on stories from France, the Maghreb, West Africa, the Caribbean, and North America, we will consider how storytelling and folktales both reaffirm and critique social structures and how, in former colonies of France, adaptations respond to (post)colonial realities. Using a comparative approach, we will examine how similar folkloric plots are treated across different contexts, but also how and why certain tales are privileged in each culture. Along with critical readings and films, we will study adaptations by d’Aulnoy, Perrault, Ben Jelloun, Mammeri, Senghor, Dadié, Diop, and Chamoiseau, among others. Taught in French.

FREN 1130G - Modernismes poétiques
Course Description: Poetry begins with (more) white space on the page. The modernist remaking of poetry - beginning somewhere in the second half of the 19th century and lasting more or less through the first half of the 20th – brought about an exponential increase in the volume of that space, and in various other extensions of it (e.g. into design and drawing, into the unconscious). The course will briefly examine the origins of those transformations in the 19th century and follow through their ramifications in poets such as Apollinaire, the Surrealists, Cocteau, Bataille and Ponge. Taught in French. Prerequisite: a course at the 0600- or 0700-level or equivalent proficiency. Contact the instructor to verify your proficiency if you have not taken French at Brown.

FREN 1710L - Africa in Theory Philosophy, Anthropology, History Beyond the West
Course Description: The African continent is the source of multiple theoretical reflections. From political theory to philosophy and history, Africa is at the heart of a burgeoning body of theory that this course sets out to examine. The singularity of this course resides in the fact that it will maintain, a continental perspective that includes the Maghreb or North Africa within Africa throughout the semester. Emphasis will be placed on French-speaking sources from West and North Africa, which are often neglected in English-speaking contexts. The need for such a perspective is represented by Frantz Fanon’s Pan-Africanism, which calls for the abolition of the Saharan frontier between "North" and "Black" Africa. Marginalized or simply unknown authors will be studied, including: Abdelkebir Khatibi, Paulin Hountondji, Fabien Eboussi Boulaga, Malek Bennabi, Youssef Seddik, Hichem Djaït, Mohammed Talbi, Lepold Sedar Senghor, among others.

FREN 2190M - The Literary Theory of Barthes and Derrida
Course Description: Barthes and Derrida developed their reputations as thinkers along very different tracks: Barthes from a literary and rhetorical perspective, Derrida within the philosophical tradition. Both posed persistently and explicitly the question of literature. For Barthes, this involved putting literary texts to the test of new forms of analysis based on structuralist and semiological research, while arguing for a discipline that exposed “the place and energy of the [reading] subject.” Derrida often used literature to challenge traditional philosophy, and play a double-agent role within his sense of “writing,” while also analyzing its resources on their own terms, revealing criticism’s lack of both rigor and adventure, and relating literary questions to high stakes political and ethical questions. We will study a representative series of texts by Barthes and Derrida that continue to provide important models for a critical approach to literary writing.

GNSS 0710D - Sapphic Arts: From Poetry to TikTok
Course Description: This course takes an intimate look at Sapphic culture from the late 19th century to present. Since its most recent renaissance in the mid-2010s, the Sapphic has emerged as an elusive disruptor; an umbrella term that welcomes lesbians, wlw, nonbinary and trans femmes and mascs. This seminar explores how the Sapphic functions not just as an identity category but a methodology (a way of reading, writing, looking, listening) and an aesthetic in art, design, fashion, and food. What are the ways in which the Sapphic works with/against lesbian and queer political identities? How does contemporary use of the Sapphic diverge from its past iterations in literature, literary criticism, and visual culture? How might we understand temporality in Sapphic expression (slow-burn, yearning)? Competency in Sapphic arts requires participation in seminar discussions, completion of 3 short essays, and a final essay/creative project.

GNSS 1400 - Agnotology: The Will to Ignorance
Course Description: If the will to knowledge is a will to power, what of the will to not know? How is ignorance a resource—a form of self-protection, a source of cognitive dissonance, and a tool of political control? How is ignorance produced? This course considers epistemology from the perspective of what we don’t know, what we refuse to know, and what we can’t know. Drawing from philosophical, decolonial, theological, psychoanalytic, sociological, feminist, queer, and trans discourses, this interdisciplinary course explores such concepts as Glissant’s “right to opacity,” Sedgwick’s ignorances and nonce taxonomies, and Žižek's theory of ideology as fetishistic disavowal. Texts will include Beauchamp’s Going Stealth, Derrida’s “How to Avoid Speaking: Denials,” Freud’s “Fetishism,” Glazer’s Zone of Interest, C. Mills’s “White Ignorance,” Moten’s “Blackness and Nothingness,” Ozeki’s My Year of Meats, Rivière’s “Woman as Masquerade,” and Smithson’s “Social Theories of Ignorance.”

GNSS 2000 - Method, Evidence, Critique: Gender and Sexuality Studies across the Disciplines
Course Description: Gender and Sexuality Studies is by its very nature interdisciplinary. Can we speak of any single methodology that ties GNSS together? How might scholars working on gender/sexuality acknowledge disciplinary boundaries and use disciplinary training effectively? We will start with the premise that studies in gender and sexuality are tied together by questioning foundational assumptions within a given field of knowledge and taking account of our own subject positions vis-à-vis our objects of study. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer focus, we will investigate how gender and sexuality are constructed in various contexts, what kind of work they do, and how standards of evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines. Particular attention will be given to the role of critique, affect, and materialisms, including the materiality of language, in gender and sexuality studies.

GNSS 2010R - Pembroke Research Seminar - Unwriting the Anthropocene: A Call to Experiment
Course Description: This seminar experiments with form to think about writing and poetics as modes of embodied experience. What are the ways to trace the presences and absences of the colonial Anthropocene? How do we write, visualize, engage with the disappeared and extinct, but also the processes of metamorphosis, metabolics, desire, and queer and trans ecologies that are entangled with anthropogenic crisis? How do the elements of environmental writing underscore the means by which to enliven forms of care, repair, and belonging towards a post-extractive world? We attend to Indigenous, Africana, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Global South perspectives, modes of narration, visuality and experimentation asking throughout how gender and sexuality shift what we know and how we write about it. Through refining our literary and visual arts, frequencies, and embodied engagements, we address collective practices that erode and unwrite the Anthropocene.

GRMN 1321B - Zeitungsmacher und Kalendermann: Matthias Claudius und Johann Peter Hebel
Course Description: Between 1771 and 1775 Matthias Claudius published, as its only editor, the newspaper Der Wandsbecker Bote. In 1775, after its discontinuation, Claudius started collecting his own contributions to the newspaper and to publish them under the title Sämtliche Werke des Wandsbecker Boten. Similarly, yet differently, another project––a calendar addressed to the peasant population of Baden––materialized 40 years later: Der Rheinländische Hausfreund, written by Johann Peter Hebel, who edited the calendar between 1808 and 1815. Due to its huge success, the best stories from the first four issues were published as a book in 1811: Schatzkästlein des rheinischen Hausfreunds. This extraction of their contributions for both newspaper and calendar underlines the subversive character of Claudius’ and Hebel’s projects. Both their writings went beyond the day: into a sphere where chronological and calendaric time implode.––Taught in German.

GRMN 1321C - Zur Frage des Besitzes
Course Description: In 1803 the German jurist and historian Carl Friedrich von Savigny publishes a civil treatise Das Recht des Besitzes, dealing with the question of how to describe and justify private property as possession. Almost 50 years later, Jacob Grimm delivers a lecture under a similar yet slightly––and decisively––different title: Das Wort des Besitzes, dealing not only with the history and semantics of the word Besitz but with the word itself. His lecture transforms a juridical question into a linguistic one: how is it possible (and is it possible at all) to possess a word? In other words: to turn a language into one’s own in order to possess it? The seminar will discuss aspects of this question in philosophical, linguistic, and literary texts by (among others) Kant, Babeuf, Proudhon, Hölderlin, Marx, Droste-Hülshoff, and Franz Kafka.––Taught in German.

GRMN 1441O - Childhood Imaginaries: Romanticism, Psychoanalysis, and Beyond
Course Description: Since the Enlightenment, childhood has been at the center of the Western imagination. In German-language literature, political models of society, psychological theories on the dynamics of thinking and feeling, and critical discussions of history are often negotiated on the basis of an outline of what childhood is. This is because studying how humans develop promises to provide insight into what it means to be human and permits one to construct images of how humans should live. This line of thought breaks from a centuries-old convention of equating children with animals due to their lack of articulate speech and regretting this phase. In this course, we will read key texts of German-language literature from the Enlightenment to the present day that expound childhood as a special, formative epoch of individual life that, at the same time, grants insight into social dynamics.

GRMN 1441P - What Are We Looking At?  Paradoxes of the Visual
Course Description: In Western cultures, the visual sense has traditionally received preferential treatment, having been associated most closely with knowledge and understanding, as demonstrated by the words ‘evidence’ and ‘theory.’ Especially at academic institutions, we want both ‘overview’ and ‘insight,’ to ‘look at’ something ‘very closely,’ and examine it through various ‘lenses’ (theoretical frameworks). On the other hand, there is also the obverse, where the optical stands for superficiality, mere appearance, and even deception and confusion. In other words, when we take a closer look at ‘seeing,’ things appear more complicated than they did at first glance. Texts and movies by Plato, Sophocles, Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Goethe, Kleist, Oscar Wilde, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Stéphane Mallarmé, Tuvia Ruebner, Michel Foucault, Paul de Man, Wim Wenders, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Toni Morrison. Taught in English, no prerequisites.

GRMN 2662S - Dichter––Troubadour––Poet : Gedicht––Tropus––Poem
Course Description: What is called poem, poet and poetry, in English today, is called differently, in different languages at different times. The semantics of German Dichter, Gedicht and Dichtung differ considerably from their Greek equivalents – poieîn, poíema, poietés –. A third case, indicaged by the names trobador, trouvère and troubadour, opens yet another field: of invention, discovery, and unexpected turns. This seminar will explore all three manifestations of poietic, dichterische or inventive explanations with what is called language in both their incompatibilities and similarities. Texts to be read and discussed will include Emily Dickinson, Ezra Pound and George Oppen; Martin Heidegger, Paul Celan, Emil Staiger, Eduard Mörike; Sappho, Plato, Aristotle, Jesper Svenbro; Cicero, Quintilian, Jacques Roubaud, Jean de La Fontaine, Guillaume IX d’Aquitaine, Daniel Arnaut, and Jaufre Rudel.

GRMN 2662T - The Darkness of the Lived Moment
Course Description: What is a moment? What will a moment have meant? Is a moment completely over as long as I can still conjure it in memory? The more one thinks about the moment, the more inscrutable it appears. Seemingly the most basic of experiences, the moment remains nevertheless shrouded in darkness, as already Plato, in the late dialogue Parmenides, worried. Our seminar will examine the “darkness of the lived moment,” as Ernst Bloch, the great political philosopher of hope, named it. What appears in the immediacy of our experience, is actually far removed from our understanding, but it does open onto an unforeclosed futurity. We will contemplate this darkness of the lived moment in a constellation of works drawn from literature and the arts; and in relation to theoretical texts by such thinkers as Bloch, Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, and Blanchot.

GRMN 2662U - Witnessing Totalitarianism: Fascism, Communism, and their Aftermath in German-language Literatures
Course Description: The memory of National Socialism has been as mainstay of post-1990 German politics and culture. However, at least with the end of the Cold War, national German memory culture has also been challenged by non-national perspectives, especially by the necessity to commemorate the entanglement of National Socialism with Communist totalitarianisms and to situate German memory culture within a Central and Eastern European context. To engage with this tension, we will read theoretical texts that continue to inform current memory debates (Arendt, Mitscherlich), recent social sciences approaches to transgenerational transmissions of psycho-social sequelae of perpetration and complicity (Welzer & al., Mihai, Gobodo-Madikizela), and literary texts that have brought transgenerational transmissions into the focus of public attention (Bernhard, Sebald), in order then to focus on contemporary German-language texts that negotiate the difficulties of commemorating totalitarianisms.

GRMN 2662V - Under Analysis: On the History of Truth and the Subject of Science
Course Description: The resonances between the oeuvres of Martin Heidegger and Jacques Lacan far exceed such passages as the one from “The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious, or Reason Since Freud” where Lacan explicitly alludes to his French translation of Heidegger’s essay “Logos (Heraclitus, Fragment 50).” In this seminar, participants will probe the various ways in which Heidegger’s meditations on the historical essence of truth and the metaphysical framework of modern science intersect with Lacan’s analytic formulations concerning the fictional structure of truth and the subject of science. Special attention will be given to their respective conjugations of being, logic, and language, as well as the literary writings that inflect their approaches to placing truth, subjectivity, and science in question.

HISP 0750N - Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Medieval Spain
Course Description: Spain was one of the most culturally diverse parts of Europe throughout the Middle Ages, with Muslims, Jews, and Christians living side by side in both the Christian and Muslim kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula for nearly eight centuries (711-1492), in fluctuating peace and tension. Uninterrupted contact produced richly complex patterns of cultural exchange whose legacy is variously embraced and debated today. This first-year seminar will examine relationships between Muslims, Jews, and Christians from the perspectives of literature, music, art, architecture, archaeology, and history. While largely focusing on the centuries of co-existence, we will also consider the expulsions and forced conversions of Jews and Muslims that took place after 1492, as well as the resurgence of these communities in contemporary Spain. Throughout, students will acquire theoretical bases for understanding current interreligious conflict and for envisioning its repair. Instruction in Spanish.

HISP 1290W - De abuelas a nietas: escritoras españolas y latinoamericanas de 1925 a 2025
Course Description: This course delves into the literature produced by Spanish and Latin American women writers over the past century.

We will bridge connections across Spanish-speaking regions and explore how conditions such as gender inequality, family structures, and exile, have consistently molded the discourses and works of these remarkable women. Help us unearth these writers from the dusty shelves of libraries and rescue them from invisibility.

In this course, we will read poetry, short fiction and testimonial writing from spaces of detention across Latin America and the U.S., asking how subjects in detention represent themselves, their aspirations to freedom, their physical and social environment, and the languages of defense and protection that ostensibly justify their detention. Primary texts by contemporary writers in Cuba, Mexico, Argentina, the U.S. and at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base; readings and class discussion in Spanish.

HISP 1371U - Posthuman Latin America:  Contemporary Imagination and Visions of the Future
Course Description: What does it mean to be human? Does the human experience have limits? What happens when we stop being at center stage and something else, animals, plants, technology, the climate, starts occupying our place? Historically, answers to these questions have come from U.S., European and Asian culture, their film industry, literature, speculative artifacts, and academia. In this class, however, we will search to answer these questions from the perspective of Latin American, a standpoint marked by cultural multiplicity, sociopolitical complexity, uneven development, and radical imagination. Starting with Latin American historians who have written on who is and who gets to be human in the region, we will explore various aspects of the Latin American human and posthuman condition through analyzing non-textual media, literature, cultural essays, and the historical framework that produced them. We will concentrate on materials from Argentina, Bolivia,

HISP 2351E - Book-Objects
Course Description: “To survive”, wrote Mexican writer-turned-artist Ulises Carrión in 1979, “books need to change their form”. This seminar looks at a century of experiments with the form of the book in Latin America, attending to shifting relations between form, content, materiality, and circulation. We will look at avant-garde and neo-avant-garde poetry (Girondo and Cendrars through de Campos and Martínez); books that mimic forms of mapping and travel (Concha Méndez, Bellessi, Thenón, Obrigado); plays with the shape of the book by some established writers (Cortázar, Arguedas, Piglia, Saer); and experiments with different forms of production and circulation (cartoneras, graphic novels, photo-books).

HIST 0150A - History of Capitalism
Course Description: Capitalism didn't just spring from the brain of Adam Smith. Its logic is not encoded on human DNA, and its practices are not the inevitable outcome of supply and demand. So how did capitalism become the dominant economic system of the modern world? History can provide an answer by exploring the interaction of culture and politics, technology and enterprise, and opportunity and exploitation from the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade to the 2008 Financial Crisis. HIST 0150 courses introduce students to methods of historical analysis, interpretation, and argument. This class presumes no economics background, nor previous history courses.

HIST 0246 - The Ottoman Empire and the Modern Middle East
Course Description: The Middle East is the only region of land to bridge three continents and is—arguably—the most controversial to discuss in the US today. Assuming no prior knowledge of a region that persistently captures headlines, this course provides a robust introduction to modern Middle East history, with two parts: (1) a brief history of the early-modern Ottoman Empire, from the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 to imperial collapse in WWI; and (2) the dramatic remaking of Southern Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and North Africa into a new “Mideast/MENA” region from Ottoman partition to present times. Throughout, we explore the pivotal role of this region—and narratives about its past—from a variety of “3D” perspectives: water, soil, fossil fuels; governance and trade; religion/spirituality, law, and family life; art, literature, music, and sports; and nationalism, militarism, humanitarianism, and environmentalism.

Course Description: From tango to plastic surgery, Donald Duck to reggaeton, this course places popular culture at the center of modern Latin American and Caribbean history. How, we will ask, did popular culture reflect and shape struggles over national belonging? How did foreign cultural products come to bear on international relations and transnational flows? In what contexts has culture served as a vehicle of resistance to dominant ideologies and systems of power? Far from a mere "diversion," popular culture instead offers a compelling lens onto the relationship between state and society in Latin America and beyond.

HIST 0658D - Walden + Woodstock: The American Lives of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Bob Dylan
Course Description: Emerson and Dylan are cultural icons. Emerson has been called “Mr. America” and Dylan has just won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Both had boundless energy for public performance and self-representation; both actively supported turning points in the civil rights struggle; both raged against American military aggression; both were at the epicenter of a wide circle of intellectuals, while denying their own centrality. What is the celebrity intellectual’s responsibility to society while remaining true to oneself? Poems, essays, autobiographies, songs, and movies provide insight into these eternally fascinating geniuses and their times.

HIST 0690D - Bodies that Matter: Environmental Histories of Disability in the United States
Course Description: This course places two stories side-by-side: changing experiences and conceptions of disability in the United States and changing experiences and conceptions of the nonhuman environment. Reading scholarship in environmental and disability history and relying on a diverse array of primary sources, this course traces relationships between bodies, minds, and land in the U.S. over the past 200 years. Through histories of slavery, animal labor, wilderness preservation, atomic radiation, disability and environmental activism, and COVID-19, we will ask how human and nonhuman bodies were made and unmade in processes of environmental change indoors and out, how the political meanings of disability, incapacity, and productivity were constructed over time, and what a just future for disabled life and the nonhuman world might entail. This course requires no prerequisites and introduces key topics and approaches in both U.S. environmental history and disability history/studies.

HIST 1032 - South Africa: Apartheid and After
Course Description: This course considers the most extreme form of settler colonial dispossession -- South African apartheid. We examine the ideological and capitalist foundations of economic, political, social, and territorial segregation. We also explore the range of visions for how to do away with apartheid and what should come after it. The dramatic story of struggle ended with what some considered a near-miraculous resolution in 1994. Our consideration of the decades since then reveals the compromises of that resolution and the enduring burden of South Africa's colonial past.

Course Description: This lecture-discussion course traces the rich history of Chinese political thinking from the beginnings of written history—when different visions of good governance competed for the attention of the rulers of the day—through to the present. We begin with the study of ancient political ideas, for it is during the earliest periods of Chinese history that the greatest variety of government modes are proposed. Political philosophy is the focus, but we also examine the institutions that were developed to translate ideals into action and to the tensions that arose as a consequence of efforts to reconcile different political philosophies in practice during the imperial period. The last section of the course is devoted to the radical changes in thinking and government institutions that take place over the course of the late nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries.

HIST 1205 - The Long Fall of the Roman Empire
Course Description: The collapse of the Roman Empire was the crucible in which the cultures of the medieval West, Byzantium, and Islam were forged. This class examines the tensions and transformations within Mediterranean society between 250 and 1100 CE and how these tribulations gave birth to new identities, boundaries, economies, and religious beliefs. We will explore too the points of contact between the emerging Latin, Byzantine, and Islamic worlds and how people living in the late ancient and early medieval Mediterranean sought to devise solutions to the challenges that confronted them as their worlds collapsed, expanded, and changed. Class meetings will interweave narrative and thematic lectures with student analysis of primary sources in translation. Topics include early Christianity, the body, gender, barbarian invasions and the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the rise of Islam, Charlemagne, and the Vikings. P

HIST 1210A - The Viking Age
Course Description: For two centuries, Viking marauders struck terror into hearts of European Christians. Feared as raiders, Norsemen were also traders and explorers who maintained a network of connections stretching from North America to Baghdad and who developed a complex civilization that was deeply concerned with power and its abuses, the role of law in society, and the corrosive power of violence. This class examines the tensions and transformations within Norse society between AD 750 and 1100 and how people living in the Viking world sought to devise solutions to the challenges that confronted them as their world expanded and changed.

This course examines the changing face of justice, from the medieval ordeal to judicial torture; the expansion of inquisitorial and state law courts; and the critical role the judicial system played in shaping Italian society. Using Italy as a focus, the course explores how law courts defined social, political, scientific, and religious truth in the early modern period. P

HIST 1267 - The Global British Empire, 1600-The Present
Course Description: This course charts the long history and continuing legacies of the British Empire, an entity that has transformed every single continent over the last four centuries and is widely associated with the makings of the modern world. We examine how and why a powerful and expansive British Empire emerged and sustained itself. Equally, we zoom in on the regular contestation and even outright rebellion that this transcontinental polity inspired. This course is an opportunity to think connectively and comparatively about historical experiences in America, India, the Caribbean, and Africa among multiple other British imperial spaces. We will track the making and unmaking of the British Empire by studying the evolution of global trade, labor regimes including slavery, the consumption of commodities such as sugar, as well as new ideas about governance, race, and identity.

HIST 1320 - Rebel Island: Cuba, 1492-Present
Course Description: Cuba, once the jewel in the Spanish imperial crown, has been home to some of the world's most radical revolutions and violent retrenchments. For two centuries, its influence has spread well beyond its borders, igniting the passion of nationalists and internationalists as well as the wrath of imperial aggression. This course traces the history of Cuba from its colonial origins through the present, foregrounding the revolutionary imaginary that has sustained popular action-from anti-slavery rebellions through the Cuban Revolution and its discontents-in addition to the historical processes that have forged one of the world's most vibrant socio-cultural traditions.

HIST 1340 - History of the Andes from Incas to Evo Morales
Course Description: Before the Spanish invaded in the 1530s, western South America was the scene of the largest state the New World had ever known, Tawantinsuyu, the Inca empire. During almost 300 years of colonial rule, the Andean provinces were shared by the "Republic of Spaniards" and the "Republic of Indians" - two separate societies, one dominating and exploiting the other. Today the region remains in many ways colonial, as Quechua- and Aymara-speaking villagers face a Spanish-speaking state, as well as an ever-more-integrated world market, the pressures of neoliberal reform from international banks, and the melting of the Andean glaciers.

HIST 1381 - Latin American History and Film: Memory, Narrative and Nation
Course Description: This course is centered around the relationship between history and storytelling. It takes as a starting point that history is itself political, and asks that we always consider both how and why we tell stories about the past. Together, we will critically examine a broad range of films and texts that engage with the Latin American past, and explore what they have to say about how gender and sexuality, imperialism, slavery, the church, revolution and repression shaped the region. How do films represent the past, and how do we approach “historical film”? How have narrative and documentary films been used as in various social and political struggles? Each week, we will examine documentary, narrative, or experimental films in relation to other modes of historical storytelling, from academic historiography to graphic novels, first person testimonios, memoirs, oral histories, and journalism.

HIST 1441 - 'Neither of the East nor the West': The Ottoman Empire in Asian, African, and European History
Course Description: The Ottoman Empire (1299—1923) was the longest-lived and most powerful Islamicate dynasty in history. From nomadic Turkic warriors in Asia to multiethnic empire straddling three continents, the Ottomans became the premier power in the Mediterranean world and the last to single-handedly govern most of today’s Middle East/MENA. Yet, Ottoman formation and evolution—fusing Roman, Mongol, and Persianate imperial heritages, as well as Muslim, Christian, and Jewish faith communities—remain little understood. This course explores West Asia, Southern Europe, and North Africa through the prism of Ottoman history from medieval beginnings to modern legacies, including those surviving Ottoman partition after WWI. We shall engage difficult questions surrounding law and empire, religion and secularism, nationalism and state-building, and the legacies of Ottoman rule in and outside today’s Turkey—from Bosnia to Baghdad, Ukraine to Yemen, and “where East meets West”: Constantinople/Istanbul.

Course Description: Palestinians are largely absent in histories of Palestine/Israel. This course introduces new scholarship that draws on local sources, oral history, ethnographic research to help us explore three fundamental questions: Who are the Palestinians? What do they want? And why has the Palestinian question become a central issue in global debates about the making of the modern world and its potential futures? The course covers the modern period (1750 to the present) and engages larger themes of capitalist transformation, imperialism, settler-colonialism, nationalism, and indigeneity.

HIST 1502 - The Early Republic United States
Course Description: This course explores the politics and culture of the United States between the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 and the financial crisis of the late 1830s. The establishment of the federal government still left crucial questions unresolved: the characteristics of national identity, the boundaries of citizenship, the legitimacy of slavery, and the tense relationship between capitalism, colonialism, and democracy. Relying on primary sources and secondary scholarship, the course will revisit familiar debates over warfare, sovereignty, and public policy, while also introducing students to a wide range of critical voices seeking to fulfill the idealistic possibilities of the American Revolution.

Rather than resting upon a foregone conclusion of European settler colonial “success,” the course explores the contingent and incomplete nature of empire-building even within unbalanced power relationships.

HIST 1820C - Sovereignty and Ecology: Law, Land, and Environmental Change
Course Description: Can law change rivers? Do rivers shape law? This course uses the Yukon River—running 2000 miles through Arctic and Subarctic Alaska and Canada—to explore how Indigenous, Russian and British Imperial, and nation-state sovereignties and the legal ideas they contain interacted with ecological and social life. From salmon and migratory birds to wildfires, plastic pollution, and climate change, the course covers the 1800s-2000s. Tuesday lectures will alternate with collaborative readings & short writing assignments based on primary sources, including oral histories, court transcripts, and government documents on Thursdays, with the goal of building new ways of linking law, sovereignty, and ecological change. Readings will be supplemented with secondary works of history, anthropology, theory, ecology, and guest visits from regional experts and Elders. Previous coursework in history, Native American & Indigenous Studies, or ecology is a plus but not required.

How did social, political, economic, and artistic developments during this period reshape how naturalists proposed to learn about, collect, manipulate, and profit from nature? We will also consider the ways in which colonial projects forced Europeans to engage with other “ways of knowing” and rethink classical knowledge systems. P

The new science is often associated with figures like Harvey, Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, Leeuwenhoek, and Newton. But it is also associated with new ways of assessing nature that are mingled with commerce. The question of the relationship between developments in Europe and elsewhere is therefore also explored. P

Sources will encompass a range of disciplinary approaches (philosophy, sociology, computer science, etc.), formats (text, film, graphic novel), and genres including Japanese anime and Afrofuturism.

HIST 1830B - Politics and the Psyche from Sigmund Freud to Donald Trump
Course Description: This combined lecture/discussion course explores the relation between politics and the emotions from Sigmund Freud’s discovery of the unconscious in Vienna around 1900 to the rise of populist and anti-democratic politics in the United States and Europe today. Historical knowledge generally focuses on civilizations, societies, systems, and events as they move, evolve, and transform through time. Psychoanalytic knowledge added the inner, mental (psychic) lives of people and cultures. Psychoanalysis redefined the humanities, the social sciences, and their relationships, paving the way as well for new approaches such as gender and sexuality studies. We will focus on the role of psychoanalysis as a political science, attuned to the modes of mass and media politics of the 20th and 21st centuries.

HIST 1942A - Taiwan's Geographies
Course Description: Too frequently understood only as a geopolitical anomaly and foreign relations battleground, Taiwan has a rich history as a complex site of overlapping geographies and shifting spatial imaginations. These include indigenous geographies; non-human environments; human circulation and migration in the Pacific and Southeast, East, and Northeast Asia; successive eras of European and Asian colonization and empire; and twentieth century regional and global communities of politics, labor, affect, and more. We’ll approach these histories via scholarly writing, film, music, literature, digital visualizations, and other sources.

HIST 1953S - Costs of Resistance: History Through Film
Course Description: Through films and documentaries about places with contentious histories and ongoing political conflicts, this course will examine the solidarities and fractures that resistance against colonial and foreign control brings about in struggling societies. We will particularly engage with themes around sovereignty and self-determination, nationality and belongingness, and history and memory. Such questions not only have real-world stakes for peoples' survival and political identities, but also shape in profound ways the imaginations and practices of resistance and solidarity across the globe. Course materials will revolve around struggles of Palestinians, Irish, Kurds, Kashmiris, Tamils, and Indigenous Americans, among others. The primary texts in this course will be films and documentaries that we will watch together as a class. Each week or module will revolve around a one film or documentary. Select readings will supplement themes of each film or documentary.

HIST 1961F - Women in Early Modern China
Course Description: “Women in Early Modern China” explores the changes in the roles of women and the definition of gender relations that mark the early modern period (roughly, late fifteenth through the eighteenth centuries) in Chinese history. These changes were crucial to the conceptions of women and their place in society that shaped the modern feminist movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Throughout the course we will be thinking about gender relations as relationships of power: about how power was gendered in political, economic, social, and cultural institutions and spheres; and about how the intersection of gender with class, religious belief, and medicine shaped power relationships. We will also be particularly attentive to women’s participation in these power relationships—that is, the ways in which they could (and did) reinforce, manipulate, exploit, subvert, or resist them.

We will examine the religious, political, racial, and economic bases for these slave systems, and compare the experiences of individual slaves and slave societies. Topics discussed include gender and sexuality (e.g. the institution of the Harem and the eunuchs who ran it), the connection between piracy and slavery, and the roles of slavery in shaping the Western world.

HIST 1965C - Stalinism
Course Description: In this course we will examine in detail one of the deadliest and most perplexing phenomena of the twentieth century: Stalinism. During Joseph Stalin’s reign the people of the Soviet Union experienced events of astonishing scale and revolutionary change. Rapid industrialization, massive collectivization, famine, purges, state terror, devastating world war, and foreign occupation brought unprecedented suffering and premature death to tens of millions of Soviet citizens. Given the size of the topic and the limited hours in a semester, this course focuses on Stalin’s rise to power and his reign in the 1930s. Rather than surveying the views of a wide range of scholars, we will delve into two very long works of recent scholarship in depth. This is a reading intensive course.

HIST 1973Q - Enviromental Pressures of South Asia
Course Description: South Asia is one of the most densely populated geographical regions of the world. The traditional environmentalist view of separating/protecting ‘nature’ from human settlements often leads to conflicts of resources/land use here. This course studies the evolution of environmental governance in the diverse ecologies of South Asia across four substantive and methodological parts. Part I involves readings on environmental and agrarian systems in the Mughal Empire from the precolonial period (1526-1757) in South Asia. Part II involves readings on forestry laws from the British colonial period (1757-1947) in South Asia. Part III involves reviewing a series of books and films on environmental history in Asia. Part IV involves researching case studies focusing on local environment cultures from the postcolonial period (1947 to present) in South Asia. The course requires writing a final research paper based on a case study.

HIST 1974E - The Intellectual History of Imperialism
Course Description: What is an empire? What does an empire do? What is the difference between imperialism and colonialism? How have historical actors as well as historians between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries answered these questions? This seminar considers the long history of intellectual debate over imperialism and its relationship with state formation, capitalism, labor, subjecthood, and the environment. We will read proponents of imperial expansion, advocates of imperial reform, and fierce critics of imperialism. Readings will include canonical texts authored by major historical figures such as John Locke and Vladimir Lenin as well as pamphlets and legislative debates that document the everyday practice of imperialism. In engaging with such primary sources, we will consider how rival visions of imperialism shaped ideological traditions as diverse as liberalism, fascism, conservatism, and communism.

HIST 1974P - Modernity's Crisis: Jewish History from the French Revolution to the Election of Donald Trump
Course Description: As the modern world developed and grew, the question of the Jews’ place within it became increasingly important for the majority societies and the Jews themselves to deal with. The solutions found have ranged from inclusion on equal terms through exclusion not only from society but from humanity altogether. In many ways, the debates around this issue have touched on the very meaning of modernity itself. In this advanced undergraduate seminar, we will examine the ongoing polemics on the place of the Jews from the perspectives of both the proponents of the different solutions and the Jews themselves.

HIST 1974U - Race, Incarceration, and Freedom in the Americas
Course Description: This course examines the history of mass incarceration in the Americas, focusing on the relationship between race, policing, and punishment from colonial Latin America to twenty-first century United States. Together, we will explore ways of thinking about the long history of punishment and its relationship to racial and gender politics as well as different forms of labor exploitation, and think about how different temporal and geographic framings help us think in new ways about the history of incarceration and (perhaps) point to new futures. Among the topics we will explore are the ways contemporary carceral regimes have been shaped by the afterlives of slavery; the shifting meanings of rehabilitation; the experiences of incarcerated individuals; the Cold War politics and transnational roots of militarized policing in the United States; and the ways gender, sexuality, and age shape imprisonment across the hemisphere.

HIST 1976U - Planning the Family
Course Description: This course explores 20th-century efforts to address population growth and family planning in a variety of global contexts, ranging from macro-level initiatives to individual practices. For some women, state leaders, and international experts, contraception meant sexual liberation, increased autonomy, and the reduction of economic hardship. But for others, the same biomedical technologies were associated with colonial control and efforts to reduce “undesirable” people. How is it possible for contraception to hold such expansive and contradictory meanings? In order to assess this central question, students will engage with critical theories of gender, race, class, nationalism, and decolonization.

HIST 1977I - Gender, Race, and Medicine in the Americas
Course Description: This course examines the relationships among sex, gender, race, disease and modern medicine in the Americas. Together, we will explore ways of thinking about disease and public health as topics of historical inquiry, and examine how health politics have been shaped by processes of imperialism, sexuality, and racial inequality. From nineteenth-century obstetrical experiments on enslaved women, to more recent debates over the disease threat posed by Haitians during the HIV/AIDS pandemic, race and sexuality have both shaped the development of medical knowledge and been used to isolate certain groups as threats. Social concerns over women’s bodies and reproductive capacities have also shaped medical research and public health policy across the hemisphere. Through shared readings and guided independent research, this course gives students an opportunity to explore a wide variety of topics related to the history of medicine, race, and gender.

HIST 2972A - Histories of Modernity
Course Description: Far from describing the merely recent past, the term modernity often signifies a distinct epoch in the human past. In this course, we will consider what historians studying various, distinct geographies mean by the modern period as well as what their choices might tell us about historical approaches to periodization and scales of analysis. Particular emphasis will be placed on past and present debates about the long nineteenth century as a threshold to modernity. We will consider major historiographical interventions on the Industrial Revolution, the Great Divergence, imperialism, nationalism, and mass politics and culture.

HIST 2972D - Graduate Readings in Native American and Indigenous Histories: Decolonization and Methodologies
Course Description: This PhD-level readings seminar has two primary objectives. The first is to read widely in the recent literature of Native American and Indigenous History, including monographs and articles (readings admittedly tilt towards North America, but with a keen eye to other regions). The second aim is to engage the question of methods, epistemologies, and ways of knowing, both through traditional academic writing as well as Indigenous scholarship that models supplemental and even alternate epistemologies and understandings of what it means to do history and know about the past. As part of this class, we will hear directly from 2-3 Native and Indigenous scholars and knowledge keepers to help us think more critically about where the field is and where it should go.

HIST 2972E - Readings in Oppression and Resistance
Course Description: This seminar focuses on close readings of several iconic and influential texts on oppression and resistance in the modern era. Despite our growing awareness of the legacies and current realities of oppression, the deeper history of the mobilization of resistance to pervasive oppression in the past has become obscured by the passage of time, and misunderstood through selective citation and decontextualization. By carefully analyzing and contextualizing the writings by earlier generations we can thus better understand our own time, how we got to where we are, and how we can steer our future to safer and more just shores. Some great minds in the past have thought about the questions that concern us today. This course introduces students to these voices in the belief that they can serve as a guide to grasp the complexities of our own time.

HIAA 0405 - Arts of the Sacred and the Demonic in the Ancient Mediterranean
Course Description: From rural temple to urban shrine, to elegant synagogue or village church, from household prayer nook to adorned tomb, people in the ancient world honored, encountered, and experienced their gods. They practiced a piety in which human flourishing depended on gestures, rituals, and built articulations of devotion mediated by beauty. But holy powers could also be malevolent, so ancient art served to protect, warn, or ward off evil spirits. This course will explore the art, architecture, and material cultures of ancient Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians between the 6th century BCE and the 6th century CE. We will consider a wide variety of evidence, including texts, sculpture, frescoes, mosaics, architecture, and domestic artifacts, to explore the many ways in which these distinct but connected communities expressed their beliefs through visual representations and material practices.

HIAA 2301 - Finding the Viewer: The Reception of Ancient Art and Architecture
Course Description: This graduate seminar will explore the role of viewers in the creation of meanings for ancient art and architecture. The perspectives of the makers of a work of art, patrons and artists, tend to get greater attention in art historical inquiries, in large part because those agents leave more visible traces in the literary and material records. Yet the agency of viewers, although less apparent, can be recovered through careful examination of diverse types of evidence—textual, archaeological, visual—and by relying on viewer-centered theoretical models such as phenomenology and reception theory.

Course Description: This seminar is about how artists imagine the land, and the relationship between people and the places that they inhabit. We will think broadly about how people have conceptualized “nature,” the “landscape,” and “colonization” from the eighteenth century to today as well as hone in on specific artistic traditions, including those in Africa, Europe, and South Asia and across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. This class will investigate materials that come from the land, such as oil, clay, and pigments; other aspects of the environment, like waterways and clouds; and other art forms, including music, fiction, and dance.

HMAN 1973N - Islam in America: A Global History
Course Description: This course explores the history of Muslims in America — and American discourses about Islam — from 1492 to the present. We follow five historical contexts bridging Spain and Portugal, West Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and North America, including: (1) Iberian-Ottoman rivalry from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean and European colonization of the Americas; (2) transatlantic slave trade and the roots of African-American Islam; (3) the U.S. Founders’ ideas about Muslims and religious freedom, plus diplomatic engagement with Morocco, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia; (4) large-scale immigration of Asian Muslims following the 1965 Civil Rights Act; and (5) racialization of Muslim Americans — and oft-misidentified minorities including Arab, Iranian, Sikh, Jewish, Black, and Latinx Americans — before and after 9/11 and U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

HMAN 1974L - The Coming Apocalypse: Between the Earth and the World
Course Description: A cascading catastrophe threatens to turn the earth uninhabitable and bring our world to its end. How to think, in this context, the relation between our world, the world, and the earth? Are they known, experienced, shared with others, or being destroyed in the same way? How have their differences and convergence been affected by globalization, and affected our understanding of the “Anthropocene"? Following the news on ongoing and future climate catastrophes, the seminar addresses these and related questions through critical readings of theoretical and philosophical texts, including works by Arendt, Latour, Haraway, Povinelli, Yussof, Moore, and Mbembe.

HMAN 1976H - Respiring and Conspiring
Course Description: What does it mean to breathe together, to con-spire? The seminar will start by outlining the long history of the concept of conspiracy, from its pneumatic meanings in Antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero) to the contemporary mediasphere. This will lead us to interrogate what remains of the possibility of a shared breathing in the era of climate change, gas warfare, and privat(izat)ion of air: Peter Sloterdijk’s notion of “atmoterrorism” or Elias Canetti’s idea of a “breath economy” will be brought into conversation with M. nourbeSe Philip’s writing of the “ga(s)p” or Clarice Lispector’s Breath of Life; Edgar Poe’s apneic imagination in “Loss of Breath” will resonate against the racial politics of spirometry. Finally, our readings will raise the question of breath and freedom: is respiration a mere reflex mechanism or can it be turned into an affirmative action?

HMAN 1977B - Foreign Policy Worlds:  Diplomatic Designs and International Governing
Course Description: Foreign policy unfolds through carefully crafted encounters and exchanges in both domestic and diplomatic arenas. In public and closed spaces, actors leverage narratives, venues, dress, gestures, images, and soundscapes to sustain relations with others, pursue security goals, and affect the world they live in. At the intersection of the humanities and social sciences, this course foregrounds practices and designs that are constitutive of the international stage and world politics. They encompass everyday interactions as well as protocol-driven scenes, mediatized moments, and spectacular occasions. The course draws case studies from a range of historical and global contexts, from the early modern era to the present, to shed light on key forms of international society and worldmaking, from the diplomatic list to the negotiation table to the group portrait.

HMAN 2401X - Archive Theory: Imagining Absence Otherwise
Course Description: What does it mean to work through archival silences? What archival methods are necessary to mine the gaps? Facilitated by two cultural studies scholars, one located in American Studies and the other in Hispanic studies, this collaborative humanities seminar tackles the archive as an institution, a practice, and a methodology through the tools of queer studies, critical race theory, gender theory, media studies, and postcolonial studies. We will study archive theory through methodological discussions and hands-on practice with Brown’s special collections at John Hay Library. We will engage the work of key scholars in the field of archival studies, such as Saidiya Hartman, Anjali Arondekar, Marisa J. Fuentes, and Zeb Tortorici. Assignments will consist of short and long essays, responses to archival materials, group presentations, and the organization of a one-day public symposium.

HMAN 2401Y - Faces: From Masks to Deepfake
Course Description: What is a face? Faces are generally considered unique to the being they belong to — usually a human being, since animals tend to be denied access to faciality. Indeed, face, understood as singularity, is for Emmanuel Levinas what grounds the ethical relation to the other. But faces, as deepfakes have shown, are also utterly replicable: they can be grafted, mimicked, appropriated, forged. Our collaborative humanities seminar will delve into the representations of faces (portraits, self-portraits, selfies, close-ups), the classification of faces (Johann Kaspar Lavater’s physiognomy, the iconography of hysteria, Cesare Lombroso’s Criminal Man), the staging of faces (pornography), the racial politics of faces (Blackface, facial recognition, Frantz Fanon’s notion of mask), and the philosophy of “faceity” (Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben).

HMAN 2402B - Empire: Global Perspectives
Course Description: Empires — ancient, early modern, and contemporary — have profoundly shaped the distribution of wealth and power in the modern world. However, imperial formations are strikingly diverse, and many of the entities that scholars now call “empires” were not understood as such during their own times. This collaborative humanities graduate seminar explores that diversity and examines how empires rise, fall, and perdure. While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world. We afford particular attention to local peoples’ relationships with empires, environmental history, political economy, historiography, and imperial art and material culture.

This seminar will explore how technology and humans interact via language, and what it means for humans and for AI to read and to write. The format of this collaborative humanities seminar will emphasize in-class discussion. Readings will comprise a mix of literature, including digital literature, theory, and philosophy of language. Participants will not be required to have a background in computer science or technology, but will experience tutorials on key technical concepts in order to enable them to think critically about cutting-edge developments in AI beyond a superficial level.

HMAN 2402D - Metals, Mining, and Jewelry: Making the World Anew
Course Description: In this seminar we describe and analyze how the colonial order mined the world, focusing mainly on North Africa and South America. Metals are conveyors of powers, and are seated in pre-colonial mythologies, cosmologies, and ways of being in the world. In this collaborative theory/praxis course we ask with others (Walter Rodney, Eduardo Galeano, or Guamán Poma) how these can be reclaimed through the exercise of the gestures and techniques of below-the-ground materials. What would it mean practically to overturn the histories of plunder, theft, and evacuation and imagine beyond them? A central aspect of the course is to make and visit jewelry as immanent to social and spiritual fabrics. We acknowledge the presences and excesses of the materials we work with and engage these objects beyond the colonial and monocultural imagination.

HMAN 2971F - Critique of Political Theology: Ancient Texts, Contemporary Readings
Course Description: The seminar examines political theology through critical readings of ancient canonical texts considered foundational in the traditions of Western philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. Texts from Anaximander, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Renaissance musings of Etienne de La Boetie will be read alongside 20th-century thinkers — Carl Schmitt, Pierre Clastres, Cornelius Castoriadis, Regina Schwartz, Jan Assmann, Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler, Bonnie Honig, and others. Can readings of ancient canons be both non-anachronistic and critical? Must critique be secular? Or Gnostic? Can the political be separated from the theological? What can formations of ancient theo-political imagination teach us about the limits of ours?

IAPA 1502 - What Works: Evaluating the Impact of Social Programs
Course Description: Public and non-profit sector resources are limited, and decisions about how to allocate scarce resources must be informed by an understanding of the impact of social programs and policies. However, measuring impact can be a challenge. This course provides a broad – yet rigorous – overview of the methods and tools available for evaluation of the impact of public and non-profit sector programs. Students become familiar with the concepts and methods of program evaluation. They gain knowledge and skills relevant to the planning and implementation of process and impact evaluations. We cover the pros and cons of various methods, including experimental and quasi-experimental designs, qualitative methods and mixed methods. Students will also learn how to critically review evaluation methods and findings. We will use real-life examples and case studies from a range of substantive areas to support and promote course learning.

IAPA 1555 - The Political Economy of Strategy:  From the Financial Revolution to the Revolution in Military Affa

Addressing in turn land takings, the governance of urban development, and informality in urban development, this course is an opportunity to identify commonalities and differences in urbanization processes across the world.

IAPA 1701N - Diplomacy, an Art That Isn't Lost
Course Description: This seminar is offered in Washington DC to Brown in Washington students and remotely to students on campus. It examines the practice and profession of diplomacy and its relationship to the policy process. While the practice of diplomacy and the policy-making process has a U.S. focus, the lessons learned apply to other nation states as well. We briefly review the history of inter-state relations, including the international legal basis for diplomatic relations. Diplomacy has evolved over the years and has been greatly influenced by modern technology; however, it continues to incorporate such common functions as policy formulation, representation, reporting, negotiation, intercultural contacts and interaction with the media, parliamentary bodies and other external actors. The course will provide a knowledge base for understanding the policy process and will expose students to policy analysis, memo writing for decisionmaking, negotiations and verbal communications.

IAPA 1701X - American Education Policy in Historical and Comparative Perspective
Course Description: This seminar examines the historical roots of --and contemporary debates over-- select but fundamental issues in the finance, regulation, and governance of public education. Our focus is on the American expression of these issues and debates. But we will look to the experience of other multilevel democracies to highlight conceptual and institutional differences that are of theoretical interest and perhaps of practical use. In particular, the seminar will explore how the goals of education as a public good get defined; the history of school finance and governance in America; the ways in which ‘school choice’ has intersected in practice and in theory with segregation, integration, and debates over mechanisms to improve school quality; on the problems of test-based accountability regimes; and on the role teacher training systems in educational improvement.

IAPA 1702A - Diplomacy and Development: Related but Different Missions
Course Description: This course will explore two international relations missions—diplomacy and development cooperation-- that complement one another but differ in substance and nature. Diplomacy, comprised of statecraft, policy formulation, representation, reporting and negotiation, will be treated in opening segments. The diplomatic mission is about influencing other sovereign states to bridge national differences in an effort to promote interests and avoid conflict. The course will explore these aspects using simulations, including a mock negotiation, a congressional hearing, and other pedagogical approaches.

IAPA 1702C - Inequality and Social Mobility in America
Course Description: Income and wealth inequality in America are at their highest levels in a century. Historically, one reason Americans have been thought to tolerate inequality is that we tend to believe that our society is a mobile one, where people can easily move from one social class to another. But in recent years, inequality and stagnant social mobility have been associated with increasing social and political distrust and unrest. In this junior seminar, we will examine the economic and political, and ideological factors that have contributed to this historical moment, learn about how Americans experience living in an unequal society, and consider the future of equality and social mobility in the United States. How should our society be shaped, and what are our obligations as members of that society?

IAPA 1702E - Smart, Fluid, & Out of Control: The Political Economy of Production
Course Description: New technologies like smart production, AI, and 5G, are fundamentally changing how we consume and how produce is been produced. This class explores technological innovation to better understand the changing dynamics of the global political economy and relations between the market and the state. It focuses on the concept of smart production as an outgrowth of flexible production, which is changing relationships between the human body and machine, collective and individual data extraction, and their social adaptations. Through an analysis of these transformations, the class will examine how our ideas of scale, especially the concept of “local”, and the meaning of value are being reimagined, and what effect this has on interactions between state, society and market.

IAPA 1702F - Political (dis)engagement, (de)mobilization, and dissent in Eastern Europe
Course Description: The course will explore the forms and dynamics of popular political participation, engagement, and disengagement, as they have been emerging and evolving in the region of Eastern Europe, which has been defined by popular mobilizations and revolutions as well as authoritarianism, imperialism, and large-scale war. We will analyze the variations, divergences, and commonalities between the social and political contexts of different states with a special focus on Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, whose relations are characterized by intertwined histories, power asymmetries, close connections, and extreme confrontations. By situating the developments in this region within broader global and historical contexts, participants will reflect on the possibilities and dynamics of political and societal change and its trajectories. The course is specifically preoccupied with popular politics and the ways agency is historically forged and structurally conditioned.

IAPA 1702G - Governing Marginalized Groups:  How State Institutions Shape Social Inequality in the U.S.
Course Description: How does the state govern marginalized groups? And how do the processes of state governance—from population-level policies to everyday institutional interactions—intersect to shape the lives of group members? This course will draw primarily on sociological literature and methods to explore theories and case studies of governance at the margins, highlighting the role of state institutions from courts and prisons to hospitals and schools. The course material will focus on the governance of low-income Black and Brown families in the United States, though much of what we study will apply to other marginalized groups and contexts as well. As we learn together, we will consider the implications of various modes of governance for the reproduction of social marginality—as well as the possibilities of governance for promoting care and justice.

IAPA 1702I - Governance from Socialist to Post-socialist China
Course Description: This course leads students to investigate the issue of governance under the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Who govern? Who is governed? What are the typical techniques and institutions of governance, as well as the rationales, ideologies, and interests behind them? Do state-initiated marketization and globalization create discontinuities in socialist governance? Should one understand Beijing’s reinforcement of state sovereignty in the contemporary era as a simple revival of an authoritarian regime, or as more innovative practices? In what ways are governing practices under the Chinese socialist system similar to, or different from, those under liberal democracies? In this seminar course, students will explore these questions through scholarly discussions on governance in the realms of bureaucracy, economic market, technology and media, population, public health, and family. Course materials are drawn from anthropology, political science, sociology, and history.

Course Description: In this junior seminar, we will focus our attention on understanding how culture is constructed and mobilized in defining national belonging following racial logics. We will approach the topic on several levels: a macro-level understanding of national identity formation processes and policies, the meso-level of institutional processes playing a part in deploying concepts of national culture, and micro-level experiences and understanding of these politics among everyday citizens. We will explore the nexus between national culture, identity, citizenship, and whiteness in Western nations with a focus on France, the U.S., and possibly others. Students will write and present final papers on a country of their choosing.

At the end of the seminar, students will have the skillset to grasp the highly complex nature of a global green transformation.

IAPA 1702L - How Can Activists Change the World? The Dynamics of Power and Resistance
Course Description: Who protests, why, and how? Does collective action matter for social and political change? When does non-violent mobilization escalate into full-blown civil war? Why do some social movements succeed while others decline? The analysis of how people make conflicting collective claims on each other, the state, or on third parties can help us understand why and how different forms of political contention such as social movements, revolutions, and ethnic wars have developed in different times and places with varying degrees of success.

IAPA 1801D - Politics & Journalism: A Practical Guide to How We Got Here and Where We’re Going
Course Description: Politics in America has never been so manic, so divided, so pervasive, so vital. But we’re not just in overlapping crises of government and democracy and economics and race. We’re also in a crisis of truth. It’s impossible to think about what is happening in politics without thinking about how it’s covered. This course will explore that connection—in a practice-oriented, writing intensive approach which will aim to transform your understanding both of what’s really happening in politics and how those developments are presented to the public. Fulfills IAPA senior capstone/seminar requirement.

IAPA 1801X - Surveillance: State, Capitalism, and Society
Course Description: When we talk about surveillance, are we thinking of Orwell’s Big Brother, the scenarios portrayed in Black Mirror, or Edward Snowden’s disclosures? Although technological advances have intensified interest in this subject, surveillance is not a recent development; it has been a fundamental element of modernity. In this course, we will start with the theoretical bases for understanding surveillance. The subsequent weeks are divided into three modules, each focusing on a different participant in surveillance: the state, corporations and the emergence of “surveillance capitalism,” and citizens who may embrace, participate in, or resist surveillance. Adopting a global viewpoint, we will explore surveillance practices across various political regimes, throughout different historical periods, and technological advancements. There are no pre-requisites for this seminar.

IAPA 1801Y - The Politics of Regulation: Technology, Finance, and Climate Change
Course Description: Technological innovations are a central force for economic development, but today we are facing some of their most severe and unintended consequences. Some observers argue that only market competition can enable the blossoming of human ingenuity, while others argue that state planning is essential for controlling the dangers inherent in new technologies. Rather than extol or deny the benefits that can come from technology, this course examines how governments in different historical circumstances have attempted to shape and regulate three of the most challenging risks facing advanced societies.

IAPA 1802S - Human Security and Humanitarian Response:  Increasing Effectiveness and Accountability
Course Description: Disasters, epidemics, and conflicts all pose significant threats to human security, including the very ability for people to meet their basic needs for protection, food, water, shelter, and healthcare. This course will take a pragmatic approach to understanding how the legal, ethical, and technical principles of humanitarian assistance get translated into actual impact on the ground during large-scale emergencies worldwide. In particular, we will explore the justifications and limitations for humanitarian response as a tool for addressing modern challenges ranging from climate change to civil conflict, alongside new efforts to improve both the effectiveness of humanitarian response and its accountability to affected populations. This course will cover a diverse range of topics including the history, structure, and financing of humanitarian response; the public health evidence base for common human security interventions; and the intersections between human rights and humanitarianism.

Course Description: Armed conflict significantly affects civilian populations, often on a massive scale, and often in ways that generates large-scale humanitarian crises that can last decades or longer. Professional military organizations today are tasked both with prosecuting war and dealing with the humanitarian consequences. How do armed forces deal with this dual challenge? How do humanitarian organizations? What about governments and the private sector? How do policy makers think about these challenges? What accounts for successes and failures? How do military and civilian organizations interact in these settings, and what can be done to improve their engagements to better save lives and alleviate the suffering of affected populations? How can civilian protection, aid worker security, and humanitarian access efforts be improved upon so that humanitarian crises related to conflict can be more effectively addressed?

IAPA 1804 - Diplomacy, Crisis, and War in the Modern Era
Course Description: This undergraduate seminar examines war and peace after 1945 through the lens of international relations (IR) theory. It aims to both teach students theoretical perspectives on international relations and to critically evaluate the changing ways in which states have interacted with one another since the end of World War II. What caused the Cold War? Did nuclear weapons change the way that states negotiated with one another? How much did individuals make a difference during interstate crises? Why did states sometimes fail to reach peaceful settlements with one another? What were the experiences of states other than the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War? How have social and economic institutions changed international politics in the twenty-first century?

ITAL 0820 - Pinocchio Unstrung: Story of a Puppet in the New Millennium
Course Description: In this course we will first explore the historical background surrounding Pinocchio, including its publication history and the state of Italian children’s literature in the unification period. We will then look at various approaches to the text, from (post)structuralist, psychoanalytic and theological interpretations, to then connect the novel to contemporary issues related to ecocriticism, animal studies, posthumanism, and the digital revolution. After reading the novel, the focus will shift to scrutinizing various modern and contemporary retellings, aiming to unravel the relevance of the “Pinocchio myth” today. This prompts an inquiry into the persisting presence of Pinocchio in Western culture and invites contemplation on the reasons behind its continual resurgence. Taught in English.

ITAL 0960 - Bella Ciao: Resistances in Contemporary Italian Culture
Course Description: What does it mean to resist? This course explores the concept of resistance in its multiple cultural representations. Starting from the partisan Resistance against the Nazi-Fascist regime (1943-45), we will touch upon several historical uprisings: civil rights movements, feminist movements, the so-called Years of Lead, anti-mafia activism, anti-globalization movements, antiracist activism. From literature to film/tv series, from photography to visual art to poetry, artists have politically engaged, challenged and modified the idea of resistance embedded within the identity of contemporary Italians. We look at artistic expressions of resistance performed against different forms of power (nationalism, the colonial state, the patriarchal family, the Mafia, the Church, police violence). We interrogate how the idea of resistance comes to structure Italian culture today and how it reverberates in mainstream narratives of what it means to be Italian.

ITAL 2550 - Gender Matters
Course Description: This course examines the impact of gender as a category of analysis, focusing upon its varied repercussions on the study of history, with Italian history serving as one field of focus. Participants interested in other geographical, chronological, and disciplinary areas will have ample time to purse their interests. The study of gender has profoundly shaped the practice of history in the last half century, and the course outlines its impact and its transformations. The course places in conversation diverse but overlapping historical developments: the impact of the study of gender on history; influences from beyond history that have shared or shaped historians’ approach to gender and sexuality; the particular inflections of the study of gender in the case of Italy (1400-1800); the impact of the turn to the study of sexuality and queer studies. The course explores and critiques the limits of our gender constructs (theoretical, methodological, and modern) for explaining the culture of people in the premodern world and beyond the western hemisphere, fields of scholarship where the universality of contemporary notions of gender have been challenged.

JUDS 0608 - The Parting of the Ways?: Questioning Jewish/Christian Difference
Course Description: How did a small apocalyptic Jewish movement from the backwaters of the Roman Empire turn into something that “we” might call Christianity? In other words, how and when did Judaism and Christianity “part ways?” While such questions might present themselves as straight-forward investigations into a historical event, they are not, in fact, as innocent as they might first appear. In this course, we will not seek to answer the question of the “Parting of the Ways” as much as we will critique it. Our aim is to reframe this crucial question by reflecting on the categories of religion, conversion, origins, narrative, and history, among others. We will read through a wide variety of ancient literature (including canonical and non-canonical Christian texts, rabbinic literature, Jewish poetry) and broach modern forms of “Jewish Christianity.”

LANG 0750 - Identity and Languages in Contemporary Africa
Course Description: When you think of contemporary Africa, what’s the first thing that comes to mind? IS it a megacity? Africa is the most rapidly urbanizing continent in the world. It is home to three of the world’s megacities (populations of 10 million). It is also home to one-third of the world’s languages and over 2000 languages are spoken in Africa. What is daily life within them like, and what kinds of linguistic, cultural, economic, and political roles do they play in our world? In this interdisciplinary class, we’ll look for answers to these questions in articles and mixed media, including Instagram posts, op-eds, TED Talks, YouTube music videos, sci-fi short stories, documentary photography, and more. What we’ll find might surprise you. Along the way, we’ll also do some critical reflection and self-examination: what shapes the ways we think about Africa and why?

LING 0100 - Introduction to Linguistics
Course Description: The ability to speak and understand a language involves having mastered (quite unconsciously) an intricate and highly structured rule-governed system. Linguists seek to model that rule system. This course introduces students to the areas of phonetics (speech articulation and transcription), phonology (the principles that govern how sounds are put together), morphology (the principles governing word structure), syntax (the rule system governing sentence structure), and semantics (the system that relates sentences to meanings).

LING 0511 - Language and Gender
Course Description: In this course, we will explore the relationship between language and gender: how ideologies about gender shape language, and, conversely, how language is used to construct gender and gendered identities. To accomplish this, we will pair the tools of linguistic analysis with social theory on gender. Topics include historical developments in the field of language and gender, speech act theory and performativity, grammatical gender, and sociolinguistic style and indexicality. Throughout the course, we will consider how intersections with other social identities – such as race, class, sexuality, and age – inform how people construct gender through language and how these intersections impact which communities have historically been prioritized in research in this area.

LING 1311 - Linguistic Variation and Universals
Course Description: As anyone who has tried to learn a foreign language knows, languages differ from one another in numerous ways both superficial and profound. Although there are many different ways in which syntactic structure varies across languages, this variation is not limitless; it is subject to principled constraints, and different logically independent dimensions of variation often turn out to be highly correlated with one another. This course explores language universals and the range of cross-linguistic variation in the domain of morphosyntax, what limits this variation appears to have, and what functional, formal, and semantic principles underlie this variation.

LING 1512 - Language and Ethnicity
Course Description: This course explores historical, cultural, and theoretical perspectives on the relationship between language and ethnicity, and related concepts such as race, with a special focus on the United States. It centers on class discussions informed by readings that examine how language reflects and defies ethnic boundaries and how ideas about ethnicity influence the ways people use and construe language. The course covers topics such as ethnicization, racialization, authentication, linguistic repertoire, style shifting, mocking, ideology, and the concept of the listening subject. Requirements include attendance, participation, essays, class presentations, and a final paper. Students will gain experience in collecting and interpreting linguistic data and enhance their ability to write about language from a social scientific perspective, with the opportunity to incorporate feedback into their writing.

LING 1615 - Sociolinguistic Cognition
Course Description: In this course, we will explore how language meets social information in the mind. We will address questions like: How do we infer who someone is from the way that they speak? How do our social expectations influence speech perception? How do our social experiences, stereotypes, and attitudes mediate how we speak and how we listen? How does our knowledge of linguistic variation interact with cognitive processes like attention and memory? And how much control do we have over these phenomena? Students will gain both a theoretical understanding of research in these areas as well as practical knowledge related to formulating research questions and designing studies on sociolinguistic topics.

LING 1741 - Information Theory in Language
Course Description: Information theory is used to study the abstract properties of communication systems. Can it improve our ability to understand language? We will examine how the need to communicate predicts several linguistic phenomena. We will discuss information theoretic effects on multiple levels of linguistic analysis, including phonetics, phonology, and syntax. We will contrast concepts such as frequency, predictability, informativity, and functional load, and see how they can each apply to existing linguistic questions.

LITR 1151I - Remaster + Remix
Course Description: This workshop/seminar will use the intuition, logic and esthetics of popular music forms such as punk, house, dub step, reggae and blues to delve into the complex connections between a selection of classic novels and versions of these novels retold. What tensions get reset when writers on an empire’s margin write back? What assumptions get shifted when women refocus a novel’s concerns? What are the possibilities and dangers in reconstructing classics while trying to mash them up? And why are we breathless when a stylist riffs? French Antillean notions of creolité will offer guidance. Main guide—the books.

Course Description: This hybrid seminar/prose workshop will take you to Antarctica, Japan, France, Cambodia, outer space—and to other places too. But much of your writing will be about yourself. Your cross-genre wandering through novels, essays, and indefinable hybrid works by a fascinating list of thinkers and stylists, will lead to questions about your own sense of place, belonging, contextual otherness, and the pleasures, powers and implications of your gaze. You'll search for answers through the medium of your own creative work—lyric essays, fictional vignettes, pictures.

LITR 1151X - Interdisciplinary Arts Workshop: Translation of Concept
Course Description: Art-making is an act of translation – a thought, process, question, object, declaration, desire, system, or intention is filtered through the artist and subsequently finds new existence in the form of art. This project-centered workshop is a cross-genre exploration of that filter, where participants working in differing genres will be asked to engage a wide range of materials to “translate” into their art-making process. Please be prepared to write, dance, sing, mix, draw, ask, reach, and fail, in and out of your comfort zone. Individual and collaborative work expected. For writers, dancers, architects, musicians, painters, digital artists, “non-artists.” Written permission required.

LITR 1152X - Writing with the Family Archives
Course Description: VHS tapes, recipes, birth and immunization records, letters, heirlooms, passports, a shoebox of photographs, old laptops — these are among the tangible artifacts that make up the family archive. Amid the tangible, we recognize the intangible and ephemeral matter, such as oral histories, songs, missing records, objects lost in migration now only filed in memory. how do we open a creative space for these often undervalued inventories? In this class we shall read several texts of poetry and hybrid nonfiction that grapple with familial documents & materials, while, at the same time, beginning our own archival projects. We shall raise questions about the kind of research this project entails, the ethics of writing about kin, how to work creatively with photographs, audio, objects and documents, and how to write into that empty gap of what's missing from the archive.

LITR 1152Z - Creative Process Workshop
Course Description: Creative Writing can be understood as a method of turning ideas, sounds, images, snippets, fragments, dreams, research -- and any and all of life's materials -- into fully realized literary works. The "work" of these works is hidden when we read books and published authors, and thus our sense of how excellent work is achieved can be underdeveloped or perfectionistic. When we rely on only a reader's perspective to guide us as artists, it provides little to no sense of artistic path. The path that an artist takes to develop a work is one that is non-linear, messy, and full of wonderful byways. It doesn't easily fit into an editorial perspective, and thus the way in which work is discussed will be different from literature courses. This workshop is for writers of all levels to explore in more depth their

LITR 1153A - The Illiberal Imagination:  Fictions of Disinformation, Conspiracy, and Control
Course Description: What do an artist and a politician have in common? One person might say that they both make things up. Another might claim that both aim to tell truths that unite audiences. Bearing this genre-related ambiguity in mind, this course will explore the description of illiberal and anti-progressive political ideals and systems—particularly, although not exclusively, in narrative fiction. This class is therefore also about the strategies politicians, novelists, and others use to shape our sense of what is real and to argue for particular accounts of what is valuable, just, and possible, as well as how human life should be led. We will consider the work of Margaret Atwood, Octavia Butler, Philip K. Dick, Bret Easton Ellis, Colleen Hoover, R.F. Kuang, George Orwell, Thomas Pynchon, Ayn Rand, and the Marquis de Sade, among others, attending to the ways in

LITR 1153B - Ambient Grief: Writing the Alteration
Course Description: D.H. Lawrence once wrote, "Tragedy is like strong acid–it dissolves away all but the very gold of truth." A journey through major, sudden trauma is the more familiar literary route to the excavation of such truth, but what of the quotidian grief that accompanies something as constant as climate change or as much of a slow-drip as the aging process? How do we write about grief that the world doesn't quite accept as grief? How do we use our writing to build a bridge away from isolation, and towards the universal well of compassion for others? In this class, we'll be culturing the pearls of such ambient grief, isolating what we can in order to examine the way ambient grief reshapes our sense of ourselves and sharpens our sense of the world beyond.

LITR 1230Y - Structuring (and De-Structuring) Novels: Special Topics Literature Seminar
Course Description: How to structure a novel? This is a question most novelists approach with dread, because, a) all the good plots and structures have been used up; b) plots can feel annoying anyway, like a capitulation to cinema or theater; and c) nevertheless, it is impossible to write in total darkness. We’ll dispel this darkness by reading works by a range of novelists. How do these authors strike a balance between complex thought and elegant/unusual structure? And how can we, as writers, maintain narrative coherence over the course of hundreds of pages?

Course Description: We will study writing and, more generally, language art in terms of reading, both reexamining theories and practices of writing — in linguistics, the philosophy of language, and in the actual making of literature — and also by proposing that reading is constitutive of language regardless of its medium. What is reading, historically, theoretically, and in the digitally mediated future of culture? If reading brings language into being, then how should we read and what should we compose to be read? Readings from Saussure and Ong to Hayles, Derrida, and beyond. Optional critical-creative project.

In this seminar we will examine texts like Michael Ondaatje's Coming Through Slaughter, Toni Morrison’s Beloved and W.G. Sebald's The Emigrants as part of an exploration of that prose which, if we can kick awake that poor overworked pearl, posits the historical as its grain of sand. Students can expect a substantial weekly reading load of primary and secondary source material and should come to each class prepared to discuss the assigned texts.

Rather than focusing exclusively on arthouse cinema, this course will draw attention to the heterogeneous body of Iranian cinema, including popular genres, exilic and diasporic films, as well as experimental, documentary films and visual anthropology. Examining Iranian cinema’s cross-cultural references, its relation to cinemas of the region and to transnational and global aesthetics, this course critically examines the category of national cinema. No prior knowledge of Iranian cinema or Persian/Farsi required (films will be screened with English subtitles).

Course Description: This introductory course will explore its three key terms "modern," "culture," and "media" through a variety of theories, historical narratives, and media objects. We will ask how different media—such as print, photography, cinema, television, digital art, online video, archival practices, and social media—yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, and feeling, structure the ways we act and engage with the common world, and communicate and collaborate. We will read semiotic theory, critical race studies, feminist, post-colonial, queer and political theory, and examine concepts such as textuality, visuality, and networks. Open to undergraduates only.

MCM 0750F - Art, Gender, Technology
Course Description: This studio/seminar course explores and actively engages with digital media and experimental artistic practices that investigate the relationships between bodies, power, and technology. Focusing on questions of gender and sexuality, we will address topics such as queergaming and cyberfeminism, disembodied AI-chatbots and the datafication of the body, algorithmic socio-affective extraction and surrogate-digital labor, Black data and the deep-web, biopower and pharmaco-power. Through technical workshops (video/coding/live-media), theoretical explorations (critical theories of gender, disability, sexuality, and race as they intersect with contemporary art making), students will engage with a series of short creative assignments and develop a major project. This final project can manifest as a digital-media installation, AI-based artwork, sound piece, art film, multimedia performance, and more. This course emphasizes a non-competitive art pedagogical model, encouraging peer sharing of creative skills and tactics, along with ongoing work-in-progress presentations.

MCM 0903C - Surveillance Media
Course Description: Surveillance media surround us; we are watched by CCTV cameras and satellites and tracked by our cellphones and computers. In this course, we will examine surveillance media as technologies of power that do not neutrally perceive but actively produce subjects. This course focuses on government surveillance, looking at drones, border surveillance and war media, but extends to other sites such as the factory and workplace. Key threads here will be the origins of contemporary surveillance in capitalism, colonialism, and empire. Throughout the semester we will attend to how some are disproportionately targeted according to race, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability, religion, and citizenship. We will also ask what it means to resist surveillance, with particular attention to surveillance in contemporary visual culture. This entails asking what it means to look back and how not to be seen.

MCM 0903D - Diagnostic Media
Course Description: What does it mean to interpret and “diagnose”? How do we interpret and diagnose others, and how do we interpret and diagnose ourselves? What forms of self-discovery are enacted? And what forms of violence might take place instead? In this course, we will explore “diagnostics” and “diagnostic media” as a specific way media is used to build meaning about others and ourselves. This course will be shaped around two key facets of diagnostics: diagnostics as a media form, and diagnostics a mode of encounter. We will pay close attention to the ways empire, race, gender, sexuality, and ability are intertwined in these discussions, and how we create worlds about our experiences, and the experiences of others.

MCM 0903E - Capitalism, Computers, and the Era of A.I.
Course Description: What is the relation between capital and the computer? To answer this question, this course attends to the particulars of the computer as a mathematical proposition, to its claim to legitimacy as a logic of superior military and political organization, and to its elaboration as something of a natural philosophy in scientific practice. In doing so, we will formulate a conceptual basis to critically assess the glittery promises of current discourse invoking Artificial Intelligence (A.I), which sees near-total automation as inevitable and the threat of sentient Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I) as nigh. We will establish a critique of the computer as a structure (as a philosophical arrangement with a specific and persistent imagination) to think critically about popular ideologies associated with A.I., often put forward by those with capital stake in its commercial success.

MCM 1205A - What We Talk About When We Talk About Horror
Course Description: The killer, their victims, the ‘terrible place,’ the ‘final girl’: components like these, associated with 1970s American slasher films, tend to dominate popular accounts of the genre—but the cinema of fear and sensation is a dynamic mode of contemporary filmmaking, transnational in its origins and circulation, and thematically and formally eclectic. This course will study the horror genre through scholarly and critical debates, emphasizing the ways both experts and enthusiasts have theorized horror's significance and social urgency, the unique properties of horror spectatorship, and the formal attributes of individual films. Each week will focus on a specific conceptual area, including monstrosity, the uncanny, Otherness, excess, allegory, haunting, and abjection.

MCM 1205G - The Politics of Contemporary Black Popular Music
Course Description: This course provides an introduction to the history of black popular music since the1970s, focusing primarily on sound cultures from the US, Caribbean, and Western Europe. We will begin by studying the mixing techniques developed in Reggae (dub), Disco (remix), and Hip-Hop (scratching and sampling) to discuss how they have shaped popular music since the1970s. We will then survey these genres as well as the histories of R&B, House and Techno and some of their many offshoots (Jungle & Afrobeats, for instance) have developed over the last 30 years to ask how popular music functions as one of the main channels of communication among the cultures of the African diaspora. Overall, this course investigates the aesthetic, political, cultural, and economic dimensions of black popular music, paying particular attention to questions of gender, sexuality, class, nation, language, and technology.

MCM 1205I - Queer Nightlife
Course Description: What do we want from a night out? What is possible in this “queer” time? And what are we wearing to the function? This seminar explores the connections between and among nightlife, queer worldmaking, and other unruly subcultural practices. Rather than a linear history of nightlife and club culture, in each week we venture to a new theme/destination. We explore the spaces, the dancing, the outfits, the laws and legal gray areas, the drag, the cruising, and the rumbling bass, textures, and frequencies of queer nightlife. Through close readings, guest speakers, site visits and sustained cultural analysis, we acquire a critical understanding of the potentialities of queer "after hours" in the making of subcultural identity and emerging aesthetic practices.

MCM 1205K - Emplaced Art in the Americas : Creating Change Through Materiality
Course Description: What does it mean to think about art, place, history and meaning making in the Americas? What kinds of visualities, imaginaries, and memories guide how we imagine South America, Chile? What are the roles of art, video, performance, and memorials as sites of emplacing memory, collective witness, creating future possibilities? Our thinking, making, and engagement is guided by social, cultural, feminist, and environmental movements and explore modes of sensing, creating, feeling and being with the land through Indigenous, migrant, “expert” and local knowledge and place. How are these projects raced and gendered? What kinds of aesthetics and art projects inform our own understandings of emplaced learning? This course invites us to think with creators and place. It will support and guide you towards making and living with art as a way to perceive with and beyond neoliberal and colonial logics.

MCM 1505B - Hitchcock: The Theory
Course Description: The films of Hitchcock often overwhelm the compelling narratives for which they are widely appreciated by threading them through meta-cinematic reflections on the nature of cinema itself. This peculiar method of construction has piqued the attention not only of film theorists, who look to Hitchcock to teach them about technique, but also philosophers, who look to him to help them thing more clearly about the nature of thinking, promising, doubting, and obsession. We will not only examine the films themselves alongside the speculations they have inspired, but also attempt to define the complex pleasures – somatic, cinematic, and cerebral –they elicit from viewers.

MCM 1505P - Channeling Race: Television and Race in America
Course Description: Our era has been called both "post-televisual" and "post-racial," yet images that define and are defined by (mis)understandings of race fill our screens (whether on TV sets or other means for disseminating television).

MCM 1507P - Politics and Film: Adaptation
Course Description: Beginning with examples of repetition, adaptation, or re-making in feminist, literary, or political theory, cinema studies and philosophy, legal studies and history, (eg., Butler, Cavell, Douglass, Morrison, Spillers) this seminar will study the re-do: looking at filmic remakes/adaptations in political/cultural contexts as iterative, citational, augmentative/aspirational or perfectionist. The aim is to consider such efforts in connection with debates in the fields of Adaptation Studies, structuralism/post structuralism, Classics' “reception studies.” The focus is on adaptation as a site of contestation. Is it conservative reclamation? or radical reform/abolition of contemporary norms, genders, institutions, and politics? Final projects can be essays or performance pieces, adaptations or analyses. All will be shared collectively in the final class

MCM 1702C - Incomputable Tales: Art, AI, Archives
Course Description: What is extracted and accumulated, what is reduced and deterritorialized, what exceeds archival and algorithmic capture, what remains radically incomputable. This advanced studio/seminar course will confront both the archive and AI dataset as technologies of power—hegemonic epistemological ordering/extraction. While doing so, we will explore art’s potential to craft counter-narratives and generate new poetics of retrieving and preserving; of holding in common(s). Key topics include feminist shadow archives, queer-life and leaky archives, archives of feelings, speculative-critical fabulation, AI-generated mean-images, and ungovernable, incomputable data. Through video, digital media, and AI-hacking workshops, analysis of art case studies, and theoretical explorations, students will develop a major research-driven art project. This project can manifest as an AI-based artwork, sound piece, video, performance, curatorial intervention, writing, and more. The course includes a visit to the Providence Queer-Archive-Work and concludes with a final group speed-show.

MCM 1702D - Opening the Archives:  The “Stuff” of (Un)Making, (Re)Pairing, and (Re)Imagining
Course Description: Archives and archivists have been described as agents with the power to control, privilege, and marginalize collections and their histories. This power can be wielded to determine the shape and direction of historical scholarship, collective memory, and identities, thereby impacting how we know ourselves as individuals, groups, and societies. These links are further complicated in archives where the provenance of collections is unclear. Students will gain a greater understanding of archival organization and authority, and are encouraged to imagine new modes of access to archives forging their own openings into/beyond the archives: making material traces and connections to produce critically engaged, creative works. Projects may take many forms: historiography; speculative, revisionist, or historical fictions; live or recorded performances; site-specific installations; single or multi-channel AV works, or curated programs.

MCM 2100K - Life is What Errs / Canguilhem and Psychoanalysis
Course Description: We will focus on the long and subtle debate Georges Canguilhem -- the famous historian of biological sciences and student of Bachelard-- conducted with Bergson. While known to many through Foucault's extraordinary praise for him, Canguilhem contributed less to the topic of social norms than to the question of the (in)curability of the psyche. "What is Psychology?" "The Concept of Life," "The Living and its Milieu" among other celebrated essays are virtually unreadable outside a psychoanalytic context.

MCM 2100O - Queer Theories
Course Description: This course will engage with possibilities and problems of queer theorizing, from the emergence of queer theory, through its (precarious) institutionalization, to its multiplied interventions. Rather than understanding queer theory as a unified approach, we will consider a range of queer theoretical work as well as challenges within queer analysis itself. Issues to be explored include formations of gender and sexuality, race and nation, epistemology and ethics, politics and communities, subjectivities and socialities, identifications and disidentifications, bodies and pleasures, publics and privates, and the temporalities and locations of our world. Preference given to graduate students; all others seek instructor permission.

MCM 2110E - The Work of Form
Course Description: Contemporary discussions of the problem of form and of reading practices have often proceeded on separate tracks. The question “what is it to read?” animates topics such as close and distant reading; ideology and hermeneutics of suspicion; figures of affect, surface, and repair. Inquiries into form highlight defamiliarization and (a)historicism; plasticity and formlessness; aesthetics and heteroglossia; dissensus and engagement. Articulating questions of form with questions reading refocuses our attention on the work of form: form as process, as productive, as reformation. Our course will approach the issues of subjectivity and theoretical objects, ideology and pleasure, new formalisms and the politics of the aesthetic in theoretical work from the twentieth and twentieth century across the disciplines. We will focus both on thinking about “reading for form” and on cognate terms for reader, spectator, user, gamer, reconfiguring our theories of form.

MCM 2120T - Media Among Themselves: Recursivity and Mimesis in Media and Performance
Course Description: This class explores mediatic modes of citation, recursion, gesture, im/possibility, redaction, and nonrepresentational mimesis. We will inquire after Rizvana Bradley’s idea of "anteaesthetics" in works such as Jaffa's appositional response to Snow's Wavelength; Lemon's nesting of Tarkovksy's Solaris within Ceremonies of the Air; Hopinka's Lore beside Frampton's Nostalgia; Cassils' recursive Haroki; Sansour's recursive Kubrik; Shonibare's redactive Verdi; and Ligon’s Hands in response to Farrakhan's Million Man March. Works that gesture (often obliquely or opaquely) by Belmore, Perry, Morimura, Leigh, Brand, Bey will participate. The title replays Irigaray's "Commodities Among Themselves" to ask after fungibility in the ongoing colonial-capitalism of the Plantationocene.

MCM 2510O - Decolonial Futurities: Submerged Perspectives from and within the Americas
Course Description: Anthropocenic exhaustion begs for new/old artistic modes of gathering and collectivity. How can we think, do, create, perform, listen, sense, perceive, and generate future-oriented imaginaries based on the texture of ancient ways? This collaborative humanities course centers perspectives, translations, and mediations from and about the Américas. We seek to decenter the liberal humanism of environmental thinking to present modes of being that emerge from the otherwise of the Américas. This imaginary is pluralistic in its linguistic, racial, ethnic, and gendered imagination. It foregrounds submerged perspectives and unearths subterranean stories that confront legacies of (neo)colonialism, racial capitalism, and extractivist exploitation. Guest participants — with the support of the Brown Arts and Cogut Institutes, Modern Culture and Media, and Portuguese and Brazilian Studies — enliven our study across the U.S., Turtle Island, and Abya Yala (the Indigenous nomenclature for the Américas).

Course Description: This seminar considers the theater shows of Stephen Sondheim in relation to the history of the American musical.

MUSC 0890 - The Romantic Generation
Course Description: Beethoven’s shadow looms large on the young romantic generation, setting off a collective anxiety of influence unparalleled in musical history. “what next?” seemed difficult to answer as Beethoven brought the abstract forms of sonata, symphony, and quartet to unreachable heights. The range of answers gave birth to a musical style that looked backwards into the Baroque for textural density and flow, abandoning the articulated symmetry of the classical phrase, while pushing the harmonic language, musical drama, and effect into new horizons. All the while, the search for alternative structures and points of musical departure, resulted in a new sort of interaction between music and other art forms. Schumann’s E.T.A Hoffman’s inspired character pieces, Berlioz’s program music, the proliferation of the Lied, Liszt’s Dante Sonata and Petrarca sonnets are telling examples of this search for a new musical style and context.

MUSC 2080H - Key Concepts in Sociocultural Theory
Course Description: Ethnomusicology has always been interdisciplinary, and is becoming more so.

MUSC 2111 - The Contemporary Orchestra: Innovation, Tradition, and Institution
Course Description: This course is a comprehensive look into the modern orchestra's relationship with new music. A major component will be examining repertoire of the past sixty years, seeing how new techniques, aesthetics, and technologies (new instruments, computer-assisted orchestration, acoustics) have influenced how composers approach writing for the orchestra. We will explore pathbreaking works that involve spatialization, alternative tunings, and improvisation. Orchestras are natural vehicles for new ways of thinking about sound and the concert experience, but in dealing with economic realities and a commitment to canonical practice, they are also the most resistant to change. What are the limitations and expectations of music created for these institutions? How is cultural prestige at play, and what roles do artistic administrators, composers-in-residence, publishers, and critics play in programming? And how might new initiatives for young composers and underrepresented voices change relationships to audiences?

Course Description: The purpose of this course is to support learning Indigenous languages. Course content is differentiated to each student according to their needs, with guiding questions: How will you learn your language? What aspects of your language (reading, writing, listening, speaking, cultural context) will you focus on, and why? What resources will be most helpful and what challenges of learning your language exist? How will they benefit your academic study and professional trajectory? The scholarly context of this course emerges from a need to address the legacies of destruction to Indigenous peoples. Given the history of cultural and linguistic genocide, Native voices and ways of knowing will be centered, using community resources, oral histories, and Native scholars as a support network for study, guided by principles such as relationships to heritage languages, Indigenous epistemologies, land relations, music, and gender.

PHIL 0021 - Living the Sage Life: A History of Chinese Ethics
Course Description: How does a sage live their life? What do we have to do to become sages? Chinese philosophers throughout history have answers to these questions. In this course, we investigate the ethics of (ancient) Chinese sagehood and how they relate to a good and moral life, with a special focus on different variations of Confucianism and Daoism. We will start with Confucius, Mencius, and Zhuangzi in the Warring States, to Laozi in the Western Zhou Dynasty, and end with Wang Yang Ming in the Ming Dynasty. Crucially, the course involves an experimental element: students will be asked to not only think about sagehood, but also experiment with living like a sage. We will thus be experimenting with several meditation methods, reflection methods, and discussion methods. This course will also involve a field trip to an art museum.

PHIL 0024 - Philosophy of AI
Course Description: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have already begun to reshape our world, raising a host of new practical and theoretical challenges. Do Large Language Models generate and understand text as humans do? Or might contemporary AI present a new and radically alien form of intelligence? Could artificial systems ever become conscious? And how might we foresee and forestall potential negative impacts of AI, including the spread of misinformation and the replication of human biases in artificial systems? In this course, we will exploring these and related philosophical questions as we trace the rise of artificial intelligence from the days of Alan Turing to today’s cutting edge deep neural networks.

PHIL 0025 - Capitalism versus Socialism
Course Description: Capitalism is the world’s dominant economic system. Billions live under it; arguably, the majority of us do, and even those who do not are affected by it. Yet many wish we did not. Historically, the greatest opposition has come from those who have described themselves as socialists. While socialism underwent a loss of popularity in the latter part of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st due to the failures of self-described socialist regimes, it appears to be regaining popularity, at least among younger generations. But which is in fact better: capitalism or socialism? The question can still provoke heated debate. In this course, we will explore the ethical arguments for and against these economic systems, as well as ethical questions that each system raises. The goal will be to equip you to compare the systems.

PHIL 0093 - The Philosophy of Health, Illness, and Disability
Course Description: In this class, we will investigate health, disability, and illness—and the roles they play in our philosophical theories in our lives. Topics include the nature of health, illness, and disability; normative questions about their value and their relationship to well-being; and epistemological questions about the sources of evidence we can and ought to use to think about these issues, including personal experience and testimony. The course will also serve as an introduction to philosophical thinking more generally: an opportunity to begin to develop philosophical skills, in connection with topics that we care about deeply. This is a first-year seminar (FYS), and so enrollment is restricted to first-year students. It is a conversation-based seminar, in which students will learn to work together in philosophical inquiry.

Topics include: naive realist versus representational theories of sensory experience, the possibility that sensory experience is massively illusory (so that we already occupy a kind of “virtual reality”), the role of the brain in shaping sensory experience, and the alleged foundational role of sensory experience in knowledge. The focus will be on vision but we will also discuss other sense-modalities. Prerequisite: at least 2 previous courses in philosophy.

PHIL 0990V - Current Questions About Rational Belief
Course Description: We'll study some "hot topics" in epistemology. Some possible questions: (1) What's the relationship between rational belief and logic? (2) Is belief best thought as all-or-nothing, as coming in gradations, or both? (3) Can the same evidence support divergent belief-states? (4) Is rational belief completely determined by evidence, or also by values or practical interests? (5) Are graded beliefs best seen as coming in precise degrees, or as more "spread-out"? (6) Can I have rational beliefs I know are denied by others just as intelligent, unbiased, well-informed, etc., as I am? Enrollment limited to 20 juniors and seniors.

PHIL 0992A - Puzzles of Rationality
Course Description: What is it to be rational? This course takes up that question by looking at a number of intriguing puzzles. For example: Is it irrational to not believe in God? Is it irrational to settle for less now when you could have more later? Is it irrational to intend to do something that you don't believe you'll do? Can it be rational to do what you hope you won't? When is it rational to be random? Is it ever rational to be irrational? Along the way, we will learn bayesian probability theory, decision theory, game theory, and social choice theory.

PHIL 1005 - Punishment and Justification
Course Description: A central concern in legitimizing our criminal justice system is the justification of punishment. Given the objectionable nature of the intentional imposition of harm, a failure to adequately justify the practice can call into question its persistence. For democratic societies in particular, the question of whether punishment can be adequately justified is of special concern. This course will survey the major philosophical justifications for legal punishment. Special focus will be placed on the expressive dimensions of punishment, the punishment of adolescent offenders and the possibility of their incarceration with adults, as well as arguments for and against the abolition of incarceration as a form of punishment.

PHIL 1012 - Climate Ethics
Course Description: Climate change challenges our way of life and our institutions. The impact of climate change is not the same all over the globe. Developing countries may suffer worse consequences than wealthier countries. At the same time wealthier countries are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions. Maybe we can mitigate or adapt to climate change, but the question whether we should do something about climate change is an ethical question. The ethical question is complex. Who is morally responsible for climate change? Individuals? States and nations? Can past generations be held responsible for their greenhouse gas emissions? Do we have moral obligations toward future generations? Should all countries bear the burden of climate change equally?

PHIL 1155 - Hellenistic Ethics
Course Description: The philosophers we’ll read in this course have a lot of advice for us. Epicurus recommends that we “[g]et used to believing that death is nothing to us” (Letter to Menoeceus, trans. Inwood and Gerson). Epictetus tells us: “Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well” (Handbook 8, trans. White). Lucretius describes at length the “ills” that are “experienced in love that is steadfast and supremely successful”—and adds that “when love is frustrated and unrequited, the miseries you can spot with your eyes shut are countless” (On the Nature of Things 4, trans. Ferguson Smith). What are we to make of all this advice? And what’s behind it?

PHIL 1485 - The Quantified Self
Course Description: Self-quantification is ubiquitous. From smart watches that track biometrics and sleep quality to productivity trackers which tell us how we actually spend our time, modern digital technologies provide us with the tools to observe, measure and collect data about ourselves at great levels of detail. But does this data really help us understand ourselves better? Is the kind of knowledge those technologies offer worth having? Does a quantified self lead to a happier self? In this course, we will explore self-quantification through a range of philosophical perspectives and debates from ethics and political philosophy to epistemology.

PHIL 1501 - Well-Being
Course Description: In this course, we map out and examine the various dimensions of the domain of prudential value, or what pertains to well-being. We begin with important features of the concept of prudential value itself, such as subject-relativity, the experience requirement, and the categories of prudential value (e.g., subjectivist and objectivist). We examine classic theories of well-being: hedonistic, desire, and eudaimonistic theories, as well as new theoretical options (internalist and constitutivist theories). Then we consider different varieties of prudential goods, including happiness, meaningfulness, achievement. Finally, we look at questions of the proper scope of prudential value, in particular whether it is best understood as a property of a whole life.

PHIL 1593 - Seminar on Bioethics Through Fiction: Disability, Illness, and Death
Course Description: This seminar uses fiction as well as conventional bioethical material as a vehicle for philosophical discussions of disability, illness, and death. Topics include the following: What is disability? What is illness? What do healthy and able-bodied people owe sick, disabled, or dying people, and vice versa? Should we “accept” death, stave it off, or does this depend (on what)? How can fiction enrich philosophical discussions of such questions? In order to include students with a wide range of interests and backgrounds, this seminar has no prerequisites. It is an in-person seminar with all sessions available for remote participation by students who have valid reasons for not being able to attend in person, although the two weeks on quadriplegia will be fully remote to familiarize you with the educational feature of such classes, including their advantages for many disabled people.

PHIL 2106 - Plato on Pleasure and the Good Life
Course Description: This seminar will focus on Plato’s Philebus: his investigation of pleasure, knowledge, and the good life. The Philebus is an ethical dialogue, which also explores method, metaphysics, cosmology, and epistemology, with fascinating treatments of sound and color. We aim to discuss the dialogue in detail and to consider relevant passages in other dialogues, such as perception and judgment in the Theaetetus, falsehood in the Sophist, two arts of measurement in the Statesman, the Good in the Republic, and perception and perceptible qualities in the Timaeus. Our questions include: what method is advocated in the Philebus and how does it relate to similar methods in the Phaedrus, Sophist, and Statesman? Plato’s Socrates plays with the notions of limit, unlimited, mixture, and cause. How do those notions contribute to his investigation of pleasure, knowledge, and the good life?

PHIL 2140K - Rationality
Course Description: This seminar focuses focus on recent literature about the nature of rationality. Questions to be discussed include: Why should we be rational (and what does that question even mean)? Can desires or emotions count as rational or irrational? Which mental states can count as rational and why? Is there a unified account of rationality across mental states? What is the relationship between "substantive rationality" and "structural rationality"?

PHIL 2141 - The Philosophy of Roderick M. Chisholm
Course Description: Roderick Chisholm was one of the most important American philosophers during the second half of the 20th century. This seminar is organized around the work of Chisholm, but it is not just about him. Chisholm had distinctive positions on most of the major topics in epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of mind, positions that were subsequently built upon or challenged by others. Tracing his views and the responses to them can thus serve as something of a history of metaphysics and epistemology over a 50-year period, leading up to contemporary debates and providing background for them. My plan is to pair the reading by Chisholm each week with one or more readings by other philosophers who subsequently expounded his work, built on it, criticized it, or set forth competing positions.

PHIL 2152 - Agency
Course Description: The task of the philosophy of action was once described as telling the difference between a person’s arm rising and a person raising his arm. Agency is the property of being a creature who acts. This course is an exploration of agency. Questions to be discussed: What is the difference between things we do and things that happen to our bodies or our minds? Is there something special about humans acting as opposed to, say, cats who do things? What does it mean to act rationally and respond to reasons? Do we really decide which desire to act on, or does the strongest one always win? What happens in cases of drug addiction and other mental disorders? Can you intend to do something you don't know you'll do? Where does moral responsibility come in? How can you deceive yourself?

PHIL 2515 - Group Agency
Course Description: Many believe that the U.S. was wrong to invade Iraq in 2003. Can the country itself be guilty of a wrong, or is that just loose talk meant to summarize the wrongdoing of a bunch of individual Americans? More generally, it is common to think of some groups of people, as distinct from the individuals themselves, as believing, wanting, intending, or deciding certain things, and the group itself as being permitted, forbidden from doing certain things, or responsible or to blame for some of the its actions. A related idea is so-called structural injustice (e.g., structural racism or sexism) in which a society is wrongful in its structures and institutions in some way irrespective any wrongful individual members. In this seminar we will study the difficult philosophical problems each of these ideas raises.

PLSH 1050 - Polish Cinema: Uneven Histories, Uneasy Aesthetics
Course Description: This course offers an in-depth survey of Polish cinema, spanning from the influential era of the Polish Film School (1955–65) through the Cinema of Moral Anxiety (1976–81) to contemporary, critically acclaimed cinematic expressions. We will begin with seminal works by directors such as Andrzej Wajda, Roman Polański, Andrzej Żuławski, and Krzysztof Kieślowski, exploring their unorthodox aesthetic innovations and thematic preoccupations, including Poland’s infamous legacy as a site of excessive violence during the Second World War, as well as the existential condition of individuals under socialism. Subsequently, we will transition to the post-communist era, focusing on contemporary efforts to revisit Poland’s past through haunting explorations of Polish-Jewish relationships, attentiveness towards minority groups, and the darkly comedic depictions of “the provincial” in films by Paweł Pawlikowski, Małgorzata Szumowska, and Wojtek Smarzowski, among others.

POLS 0821D - How to Think in an Age of Polarized Politics
Course Description: Americans today live in a time of deep political polarization, cultural tribalism, and self- segregation. Those with whom we have deep disagreements, assuming we interact with them at all, are often viewed as not just wrong but as irrational, immoral, or even contemptible. What are the causes and costs of these trends? What remedies might exist? Are there habits of mind that we might cultivate to build better citizens and a healthier democracy? This course develops and applies these habits of mind through conversations on a series of political topics. As a first-year seminar with discussion, this course will provide students with the tools of critical thinking and civil discourse that allow scholarly engagement and intellectual growth at Brown and beyond.

POLS 0920K - The Black Vote: A Critical Interrogation of a Concept
Course Description: “The Black Vote” as a concept, simultaneously captures a truth and distortion. It reflects the truth that no other racial group comes close to the uniformity of Black Americans’ voting behavior within American electoral politics. Yet, this truth distorts or obscures the diversity of political opinions and ideological dispositions that animate a dynamic black American public. This course examines “the Black vote” through analyzing the historical context of its emergence and the host of contemporary democratic dilemmas that surround its persistence.

POLS 1445 - Contemporary African Politics
Course Description: This course introduces students to the study of contemporary African politics. The questions that motivate the course are: How did authoritarian regimes arise in most countries after African independence? Why have some African countries become democratic, while others have remained authoritarian? What accounts for patterns of conflict and civil war across countries? Throughout the semester, we will see that there is significant variation within Africa in the strength of states, levels of economic growth, and respect for democratic institutions; we will aim to explain these variations. We will primarily study events in particular African countries, but will also examine broad patterns across countries and use social science concepts and methods to try to explain them. In our exploration, we will mostly build on the work of political scientists but also draw heavily on work by journalists, psychologists, economists, and historians.

POLS 1822G - The Political Economy of Hard Policy Problems
Course Description: Will tackle the “hard problems” governments sometimes have to deal with. For example, while governments are often cajoled and enjoined to produce economic growth, especially during recessions, do something about economic inequality and social mobility, and improve the life chances of millions through purposive action, actually delivering these things is incredibly hard. These areas constitute ‘“hard problems” for two main reasons. Economically, we don’t really have much of a clue about how to do many of these things. Politically, there are powerful interests that like these areas of policy just as they are, and they work to keep them “hard problems.”

Course Description: Managing migration waves is one of the big challenges of our time, one that is destined to increase in importance as climate change, conflicts, and economic inequality continue pushing people to move. This course provides an overview of cutting-edge research on the causes and consequences of migration.

Are immigrants good or bad for the economy? We will discuss the questions at the center of the political debate on migration and critically evaluate each argument based on scientific knowledge. Our discussions will be rooted in specific country cases (Ukraine, Syria, Bangladesh, East Africa, Pacific Islands,…), which we will use to learn about migration episodes and as a basis for a fact-based discussion.

POLS 1825S - Latino Politics in the United States
Course Description: Latines have often been described as the sleeping giant of United States politics. Although Latines make up nearly one in five people in the United States, the group has the lowest political participation rates of all the racial/ethnic groups in the United States. During this course, we will consider how Latines interact with United States politics. We begin by discussing Latine ethnicity and analyzing the extent to which Latines have politicized identities. We will examine historical and demographic trends, including immigration patterns and Latine social/labor movements, to see whether historical trends explain present behavior. We will also discuss topics related to Latine public opinion, voting patterns, and political representation. We will use what we learn during the course to discuss what role, if any, Latines will play in the future of United States politics.

POLS 1825W - Monuments, Citizenship, and Belonging
Course Description: Struggles over racist monuments—from defacement, to unsanctioned removal by protesters, to laws passed to “protect” statues—raise important questions about the political impact of commemoration. From the perspective of political theory, this course will analyze the civic work of monuments. Some of the key questions we will grapple with include: Do monuments matter? What civic function do they serve? When should they be removed? Thinking critically about monuments will allow students to consider how public memory is produced, whom it should represent, and what forms of commemoration are appropriate in diverse democratic societies.

POLS 2065 - Public Bureaucracy
Course Description: The influence of bureaucratic policymaking looms large. Some estimates suggest that 90% of laws in the United States arise government agencies, not from elected legislatures. When do public bureaucracies abet democratic governance? When do they disrupt or abet anti-democratic political forces? What roles do “publics” play in “public bureaucracy?” This course on public bureaucracy considers these questions—and many more—through its systematic study of bureaucratic structures, politics, operations, and implications for democratic governance. The course provides opportunities to critique and construct theories and empirical analyses of public bureaucracies. It also provides opportunities for students to prepare for the comprehensive exams and to develop research agendas. This graduate course counts either as an American Politics or Comparative Politics elective for the doctoral program in political science, and it does not have prerequisites.

POLS 2215 - Comparative Political Economy
Course Description: This course covers the main currents of comparative political economy. This sub-field has roots in International Political Economy, Fiscal and Economic Sociology, and Economics. It has as its main foci the politics of economic growth, distribution and (in)equality. The growth program emerged from work on comparative capitalisms in the 1970s and 1980s, coalescing in the highly influential Varieties of Capitalism literature in the 2000s, and latterly in the Growth Models research program. The distributional strand of work focused on the interaction of producer groups and sought to tie political and economic outcomes to the relative strength of such groups. The (in)equality side of the subfield emerged out of studies of welfare states and engagement with the social metrics of comparative economic performance. This course surveys this broad terrain.

POLS 2400 - Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research
Course Description: This graduate seminar offers an introduction to the design and implementation of social science research that deploys qualitative data and analysis in conjunction with other methods of inquiry. We explore the set of tools that is conventionally considered to comprise qualitative methods, including case studies, small-N comparisons, process tracing, sequential analysis, interviews and participant observation. Starting from the premise that each research method has its strengths and weaknesses, we also consider how qualitative methods can be combined productively with other methods of inquiry, including “large-N” quantitative analysis, experiments, spatial/geographic analysis, and multilevel analysis spanning different scales.

POBS 2400 - Decolonial Futurities: Submerged Perspectives from and within the Americas
Course Description: Anthropocenic exhaustion begs for new/old artistic modes of gathering and collectivity. How can we think, do, create, perform, listen, sense, perceive, and generate future-oriented imaginaries based on the texture of ancient ways? This collaborative humanities course centers perspectives, translations, and mediations from and about the Américas. We seek to decenter the liberal humanism of environmental thinking to present modes of being that emerge from the otherwise of the Américas. This imaginary is pluralistic in its linguistic, racial, ethnic, and gendered imagination. It foregrounds submerged perspectives and unearths subterranean stories that confront legacies of (neo)colonialism, racial capitalism, and extractivist exploitation. Guest participants — with the support of the Brown Arts and Cogut Institutes, Modern Culture and Media, and Portuguese and Brazilian Studies — enliven our study across the U.S., Turtle Island, and Abya Yala (the Indigenous nomenclature for the Américas).

POBS 2500N - Got Rights? Human Rights and Contemporary Brazilian Literature
Course Description: Portuguese sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos states that nowadays, there is a “global hegemony of human rights as a discourse of human dignity” (2015: 22). Nonetheless, Sousa Santos observes that this hegemony is challenged by a reality of widespread human rights abuses. What then, is the value of human rights and what role does literature play in the discursive construction and the praxis of human rights? This course examines how contemporary Brazilian literature conceptualizes human rights through topics such as authoritarianism, class, race, urban space. The course also establishes connections between human rights in Brazilian and select Spanish American texts.

MPA 2229 - Principles and Practices of Stakeholder Engagement
Course Description: This class will introduce you to various types of policy stakeholders, from executives to the mass public. You will identify those actors, the combination of authorities, powers, interests, and constraints each one possesses. This framework for viewing stakeholders will enable you to strategize about how to engage different actors when and where they intervene in the policy process. As a policymaker, analyst, or advocate, you will have to contend with stakeholders that possess formal authorities to shape the policy process. These stakeholders will determine whether the problems that concern you reach the agenda; whether your preferred solution is adopted; how that policy solution is implemented; whether it diffuses from one political venue to another; and whether the policy endures, or reshapes politics, succumbs to termination or reform. We will catalog those authorities and powers and observe how they apply in real policy situations.

MPA 2603 - Leading for Impact
Course Description: Students in Leading for Impact will explore multiple leadership paradoxes such as: in every context, people are both more connected than ever—mostly digitally—and at the same time more socially and politically polarized, and lonely, than ever. Engaging with the concepts of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in an authentic and vulnerable way is critical for leaders. Creating impact requires a thorough understanding of the problem at hand. A common mistake policy-makers, politicians, executives, or social business founders make is to address the problem they want to tackle as if it were “technical” i.e. only requiring expertise and appropriate tools. However, wicked problems have “adaptive” aspects: their root causes and their impact have to do with people’s beliefs, values, habits, or behaviors. Leaders need to use Emotional Intelligence to leverage their own strengths as well as the conditions that enable success,

Although the course will focus on mature public health policy in the United States, it will do so within two broad perspectives, historical and global.

PHP 1070 - Global Burden of Disease
Course Description: This is an advanced introduction to global public health, defining and critically examining key topics and concepts through an interdisciplinary lens. From historical efforts in mid-20th century international health assistance, to the early 21st century explosion of global health funding, to current efforts to decolonize global health and engage in more equitable global partnerships, this course examines major social and scientific developments. Readings, lectures, in-class discussions and small groups explore changes in the underlying causes of morbidity and mortality during global social, economic and health transitions, the biological and social ecology of global disease patterns, and efforts to improve health in under-resourced settings. Guest lecturers offer different perspectives on the global burden of disease. An in-depth research paper worth 40% of the final grade is the scholarly centerpiece of course; this is a rigorous semester-long project. There are two exams.

PHP 1450 - COVID-19, Public Health, and Health Policy
Course Description: The impact of COVID-19 on US society has been profound. Caused by the newly emergent SAR-COV2 virus, the pandemic required public health practitioners and healthcare systems to pivot to keep the public safe under challenging circumstances. In the US, local municipalities, state governments, and the federal government developed varying, and at times conflicting, policies to guide the public health response. Using a case-study approach, this course will explore how public health and health policy intersected and clashed in responding to this 100-year pandemic. We will examine how different states and federal agencies responded to COVID-19 and learn from leaders directly involved in the pandemic response.

PHP 1460 - Public Health in a Changing World: Law, Policy & Justice
Course Description: Laws and policies shape public health in profound ways. The U.S. Constitution frames and limits government authority to protect and promote public health. It also provides protections for individual rights that often are in tension with public health’s focus on the common good. Federal, state and local laws and policies structure the distribution of society’s resources and—as interpreted, implemented and enforced—can have serious implications for health equity. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deeply polarized views among Americans about the role of government in public health and has laid bare vast structural health inequities. This course will explore the Constitutional foundations of public health law; how public health powers are distributed across different levels and branches of government; legal and policy strategies for addressing infectious and chronic diseases and injuries; and the role of laws and policies in structuring—and remedying—health inequities.

PHP 2232 - Contemporary History of Epidemiologic Methods
Course Description: In 1987 Sander Greenland published a historical anthology of key papers in epidemiologic methods that were published between 1946 and 1976. In this class, we pick up where Greenland left off, reviewing papers published between 1976 and 2010 that represent some of the major methodological innovations since the publication of his anthology. Our goal is to develop a deeper understanding of the methods by reading the original papers and placing them in the context of what was occurring in the field at the time. Although our focus is on the development of methods in the field of epidemiology, what constitutes an “epidemiologic method” has become less clear as the lines dividing fields have blurred. Thus, several of the papers we will review come from the fields of computer science, econometrics, and biostatistics, among others.

PHP 2700 - Lessons (Un)Learned in Public Health and Humanitarian Response: A Historical Perspective
Course Description: Public health challenges complicate the response to humanitarian crises around the world, including disease outbreaks, war, and forcible displacement. Although the common narrative in our field is that the complex social, political and ideological challenges we're facing is unprecedented, an examination of the history of public health in acute crises reveals that many struggles confronting us today are neither entirely novel nor unique. This course posits that public health experts rarely understand the full nature of previous crises, and argues that a better understanding of historical events will improve our response to future crises. Through thoughtful reflection and interactive discussion, we will explore the oft-repeated themes that continue to challenge public health and humanitarian response to this day, and examine the progress we’ve made as a field. Most importantly, we will question why lessons identified so often fail to become lessons learned.

RELS 0012 - The Religious Lives of Everyday People
Course Description: For centuries, scholars have looked to religious institutions, theological doctrines, and sacred texts to explain religion’s form and function in culture and society. And while this approach has enabled scholars to neatly prescribe what counts as religious, it’s also caused them to ignore the ways people’s daily faith practices make a mess of this work. Drawing on sub-fields in religious studies, anthropology, and sociology, this course explores how formal ideas of religion expand when confronted with the normality of everyday life. From cooking and talking to prayer and devotion, the “religious” and “non-religious” things people do tell us a lot about how religion animates and is animated by lived experience, and how porous the boundary is between the “sacred” and “profane”.

Course Description: Death is universal but seldom discussed in contemporary culture.

How does death influence the living? Is there an afterlife? What should be done with dead bodies? The class will move between theories and practices, and past and current events. Coming to terms with these diverse materials may reveal to us some of our own assumptions about death, dying, and the afterlife.

RELS 0067 - Divine Drugs: Psychedelics, Religion, and Spirituality
Course Description: From LSD to magic mushrooms, mescaline to ayahuasca, psychedelics are drugs that alter consciousness and perceptions of reality. This course investigates the central role that religion and spirituality have played in the long, tangled history of psychedelics, from colonial eradication of psychedelics as indigenous sacraments, to psychedelic modes of expanding consciousness in 1960s counterculture; from the moral panic around these substances as a tool of mind control, to their present scientific investigation as a panacea for mental health, addiction, and self-realization. Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.

RELS 0290H - Defense Against the Dark Arts in the Ancient World
Course Description: Alongside their Jewish and Pagan neighbors, ancient Christians sought to control and defend themselves against unseen forces teeming around them. They bound powerful angels to their will and harnessed the spirits of the recently deceased to activate their spells. Though none found the Elixir of Life, they left behind spells, recipes, and talismans as evidence of their quest to master spirits both hostile and sympathetic. This course will interrogate Christian and non-Christian conceptions of magic, its relationship with “religion” and “philosophy,” contextualize Christian magical practices alongside their neighbors, and conclude by examining the reception of “magic” into the modern West.

RELS 0405 - Arts of the Sacred and the Demonic in the Ancient Mediterranean
Course Description: From rural temple to urban shrine, to elegant synagogue or village church, from household prayer nook to adorned tomb, people in the ancient world honored, encountered, and experienced their gods. They practiced a piety in which human flourishing depended on gestures, rituals, and built articulations of devotion mediated by beauty. But holy powers could also be malevolent, so ancient art served to protect, warn, or ward off evil spirits. This course will explore the art, architecture, and material cultures of ancient Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians between the 6th century BCE and the 6th century CE. We will consider a wide variety of evidence, including texts, sculpture, frescoes, mosaics, architecture, and domestic artifacts, to explore the many ways in which these distinct but connected communities expressed their beliefs through visual representations and material practices.

RELS 0526 - This Whole World is OM: Mantras in Indian Religions
Course Description: A mantra is a syllable or formula used in ritual and meditation. Mantras are central to Indian religions—not only Hinduism, but also Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Sikhism. Some mantras are made up of words and language—usually in Sanskrit—while others are sound fragments with no semantic meaning. The sacred syllable OM, now a global symbol of Eastern spirituality, exemplifies the power and authority of mantra. What are mantras? What do they accomplish? How do they shape identities, beliefs, and practices? Engaging with sacred utterance in various media, this course explores the world of mantras in India and beyond.

RELS 0535 - Self Transformation and Transcendence in Later Daoist Contemplative Traditions
Course Description: Who are we? How do we fit in the universe? Like many other systems of thought around the world, the Daoist tradition approached these questions both through the creation of texts, teachings, and theory, and through the development of at times extremely complex embodied contemplative practices. Starting from a perspective of a person not as a unitary, monolithic entity, but rather as a composite of energies and influences, these practices seek to harmonize, balance, and transform the person. This course will explore how the possibilities of personal transformation were expressed in Daoist contemplative literature from the first centuries CE up to the modern day. Contemplative practice labs will also offer students an opportunity to explore the ideas in the texts through direct experience. No prerequisites.

RELS 0545 - Confucianism and Its Critics
Course Description: This course confronts the changing historical phenomenon we call “Confucianism” on its own terms, as represented by its advocates, as well as from the perspective of its interlocutors and critics. It is an opportunity to become familiar not only with the Confucian canon and its main commentarial traditions, which undergirded education in East Asia into the nineteenth century, but also with the ways in which these ideas were rejected, adjusted, and reconfigured in early Daoist discussions, Neo-Confucian debates with Buddhists, and modern disputes over their socioeconomic, political, and/or gender impact. Readings are drawn from primary Chinese, Korean, and Japanese texts in translation, and from modern interpretations of Confucianism and its legacy. The course format is primarily discussion and short lecture. No prerequisites. Counts for concentration credit in East Asian Studies and Religious Studies.

RELS 0565 - The Sound of One Hand: Zen in Asia and the West
Course Description: When we casually hear about Zen it seems loosely associated with being cool or hip, like the seemingly mysterious “Sound of One Hand.” But what does “Zen” really mean and how did it come into the modern Western cultural landscape? We explore the Zen traditions of East Asia and trace their transmission to the West through a study of their writings and practices. From the arrival of Zen master Shaku Sōen Kogaku at the Parliament of World Religions in 1893, through the writings of D.T. Suzuki, to the Beat Zen of the 1950’s and the establishment of centers of Zen practice, we will help you to appreciate in your own lives what the Daily Show calls your “moments of Zen.”

RUSS 1895 - Bakhtin, Formalism, and Soviet Avant-Garde Aesthetics
Course Description: This course examines the two approaches to literature, which in many respects changed the course of humanistic scholarship: Russian Formalism (1920s) focused on literary “devices” and “structures,” and credited by many for inventing “literary theory” as an autonomous scholarly discipline, and the theories developed by Mikhail Bakhtin (1895–1975) and his circle of philosophers, poets, and literary critics, for whom the most important task of literary discourse was to create multiple, living personalities. The course discusses these theories in the context of Soviet and European modernist art and aesthetics of the 1920 and 30s. In English.

STS 0702 - Invisible Labor in the Making of Science
Course Description: Invisible Labor in the Making of Science is about the people who are concealed, eclipsed, or anonymized in accounts of scientific research. Many scientific workers–including translators, activists, archivists, technicians, curators, and ethics review boards–are absent in publications and omitted from stories of discovery. Professional scientists are often celebrated, yet they are expected to uphold principles of ‘objective’ self-denial. This course will explore these silences and omissions to reveal how invisibilities have shaped twentieth and twenty-first century science. The course modules invites comparisons across geographic, temporal, and disciplinary boundaries. The modules also facilitate different forms of self-reflexive practice, and will open the possibilities of research avenues for students; how we should approach research and narrative method; and how contemporary interest in invisible labor relates to established discursive traditions in the historiography of science and STS.

STS 1700D - Gathering Hope: Stories for Earthly Survival
Course Description: Human actions have had irreversible changes at a planetary level including in the composition of the atmosphere, land, and oceans, the climate, the rapid extinctions of life, and an increase in the prevalence of toxic chemicals. The history of colonialism, enslavement, and plantations are also intertwined in ruin of the environment. Feminist science studies provide a guide to the arts of noticing and staying with the troubles of our time but also for imagining otherwise. In this course we gather hope from ecofeminism in order to move towards a justice-oriented future. We do this by delving into the literature on ecofeminism alongside ecological speculative fiction. Recognizing that solutions to environmental problems require a feminist attunement, we can start to understand the implications that our ethical commitments have to the future of life on the planet.

SOC 0010 - Social Forces: An Introduction to Sociology
Course Description: Social forces constrain and empower us, bond us together and push us apart. Sociology explores the workings of societies large and small: nations, organizations, communities, families, and other groups. How do societies shape action and identity, and why are social pressures so hard to defy? How do societies distribute wealth and power, and why do inequalities so often coalesce around race, ethnicity, class, and gender? How do established practices persist, and when do movements arise to challenge them? Examining such themes across a range of issues and topics, this course provides a springboard for future study throughout the social sciences.

SOC 0300 - Organizations and Society
Course Description: We live in a society of organizations. We are born inside organizations, we are educated inside organizations, we work inside organizations, and when we die, we will be buried by organizations. Organizations are therefore central to processes that shape individual lives and societal trends, from widening income inequality, to the spread of innovations, to struggles over public policy. This course introduces the field of Organizational Studies, examining organizations as complex, multifaceted social settings. By investigating how organizations and society shape each other, students will build skills for informed, socially-responsible engagement in an increasingly organizational society.

SOC 0300I - From Macro to Micro: Experiencing Education (In)equality in and beyond Schools
Course Description: In American society a paradox exists: education is both a conduit of mobility and inequality. Schooling offers the potential for greater opportunities; yet the disparate nature of school-communities often compound disadvantages for others. In this course, we explore the complex “ecology” of educational inequality, from macro- to micro-dimensions, exploring economics, housing, intergroup dynamics, race and racism, gender and sexism, poverty and class, and other phenomena. It will provide students with a basis for understanding the relationship between education and society, and we will explore the intersectional ways that group distinctions, material and political realities impact people’s lives.

SOC 0300R - The Sociology of Race
Course Description: The course examines the main theories in the Sociology of race, racism and discrimination. It focuses on how race patterns the experiences of ethno-racial groups and simultaneously defines the contours of systemic racism and inequality. It teaches students how to lead and participate in critical discussions, collaborate on the analysis of data, write research-based policy proposals with a client orientation, and engage with current issues surrounding the sociology of race, discrimination and racism. While the focus is primarily sociological, the course takes a multivalent approach to examine how racial inequality persists in a presumably “post-racial” society.

SOC 0300X - The Value of Nature and the Nature of Value
Course Description: The central questions of economic life are questions of value: how much are things worth? How do we establish those values? Who decides? Climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental injustice make these inquiries even more urgent: how should we allocate resources to support life on Earth? Through a focus on nature and climate, this course introduces students to the ways that politics, culture, and morality shape economic processes. We will also encounter other tricky questions of value, like valuing human life, knowledge, and art. Students will leave with a foundation in economic sociology – an essential conceptual lens at a time when environmental and many other social problems demand multivalent conceptions of value.

SOC 0310 - Theory and Practice of Engaged Scholarship
Course Description: Efforts are underway across college and university campuses—in the United States and globally—to increase opportunities for community-engaged teaching, learning, and research. What is engaged scholarship and how does it challenge (and/or complement) more traditional concepts of scholarship and disciplinary knowledge? What are the historical, practical, methodological, ethical, and other considerations associated with engaged scholarship? Through investigating these and other questions, students will emerge from this course with a critical understanding of engaged scholarship at Brown University and in the broader landscape of U.S. higher education. Students will be equipped to design a course of study that integrates community practice with academic knowledge throughout the remainder of their time at Brown and beyond. SOC 0310 fulfills a requirement for the Engaged Scholarship Certificate.

SOC 1010 - Classical Sociological Theory
Course Description: How is modern society organized? What holds society together and what drives social change? Why is there such a large gap between the "modern" ideal of formal equality and the reality of factual inequality? Why do differences of class, race and gender persist? What is power and who has it? These questions have motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the arguments continue to be informed by the foundational classical theorists: Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and W.E.B Du Bois. Looking at the transformations around them – the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the spread of colonialism, the decline of religion, struggles for emancipation and much more – they developed arguments that allow us to better understand ourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic and social transformations around us. We explore the defining contributions of these theorists and link them to current debates and theories on systemic racism, gender/sex struggles, global inequalities, social movements and democracy.

SOC 1311 - Micro-Organizational Theory: Social Behavior in Organizations
Course Description: Micro-Organizational Theory focuses on the human dynamics of organizations as natural systems. It examines how individual attitudes, actions, and interactions make a difference for organizational processes and outcomes. This focus is contrasted with more macro-level approaches, which take the organization (instead of the individual) as the primary unit of analysis. For example, studies of organizations from an economic perspective are typically concerned with the performance of the organization relative to its competitors. Studies of organizations from a macro-sociological focus are typically concerned with an organization's routines and structures, contextualized by the broader environment. SOC 1311 takes a more micro and meso perspective that asks questions such as, "why do individuals in organization behave the way they do, how does this affect the organizations of which they are a part and how, in turn, are individuals affected by their organizations?"

This course analyzes the evolution and effects of women as a global solution to poverty. How did women become the targets of development? Are women empowered by development schemes we find today in their names?

SOC 1872V - Race and Wrongful Conviction in the United States
Course Description: This class examines the racial origins of wrongful conviction in the U.S. criminal justice system. We examine how wrongful conviction is created through both formal laws as well as social norms of practice that obscure how racial bias infiltrates seemingly race-neutral areas of due process. While legal scholars and lawyers examine wrongful conviction as a type of “misfire” in an otherwise functioning criminal justice system, this course considers how wrongful conviction is type of social system within the mainstay of the criminal justice system, at large. In the tradition of W.E.B. Du Bois, we examine how racism is the engine of this social system that is best referred to as “mass wrongful conviction.”

SOC 1874D - From Factory to Code
Course Description: Recent transformations in capitalism owing to the pervasive production and commercial use of data, including personal data of users of internet-related services, have seen proclamations such as “data is the new oil” and “you are the product”, and the rise of new analytical concepts such as “digital”/“data”/“surveillance”/“platform”/“information” capitalism. But what do we mean when we say data, where does it come from, what does it have it to do with capitalism, and why does any of it matter?

What common themes, beliefs, and rituals exist for these two cultural systems? How do they tend to be appropriated and understood? Moreover, how does spirituality manifest as a viable response? Research by seminal sociologist and community activist W.E.B. Du Bois and other scholars of race and racism will inform answers to these and other questions. The course will examine whether and how religion, Christianity, and spirituality influence the lives and quality of life of diverse groups. Special attention will be given to their usage by African Americans.

Course Description: Dharma—a Sanskrit word encompassing duty, ethics, law, and religion—is a common thread running through the cultures of premodern India. This course offers a history of Indian civilization from its origins up through the end of the classical period. Drawing on a rich array of textual, material, and expressive cultures, we trace the arc of human history on the subcontinent, paying special attention to the intersections of religion and politics.

SAST 0067 - Divine Drugs: Psychedelics, Religion, and Spirituality
Course Description: From LSD to magic mushrooms, mescaline to ayahuasca, psychedelics are drugs that alter consciousness and perceptions of reality. This course investigates the central role that religion and spirituality have played in the long, tangled history of psychedelics, from colonial eradication of psychedelics as indigenous sacraments, to psychedelic modes of expanding consciousness in 1960s counterculture; from the moral panic around these substances as a tool of mind control, to their present scientific investigation as a panacea for mental health, addiction, and self-realization. Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.

SAST 0526 - This Whole World is OM: Mantras in Indian Religions
Course Description: A mantra is a syllable or formula used in ritual and meditation. Mantras are central to Indian religions—not only Hinduism, but also Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Sikhism. Some mantras are made up of words and language—usually in Sanskrit—while others are sound fragments with no semantic meaning. The sacred syllable OM, now a global symbol of Eastern spirituality, exemplifies the power and authority of mantra. What are mantras? What do they accomplish? How do they shape identities, beliefs, and practices? Engaging with sacred utterance in various media, this course explores the world of mantras in India and beyond.

TAPS 0800J - Of Emotions Unbound: Feeling Middle Eastern Theatre and Performance
Course Description: How is the emotional, bodily experience of watching a theatrical production, a film, or reading a text alone different from the experience of doing so with friends in a dim room? Do feelings/moods sparked by art forms differ across bodies, regions, cultures, and media? Are sensory emotion concepts such as melancholia, euphoria, sorrow, sadness universal? Or are they historically, cross-culturally felt, framed, and situated? Do emotions, or affects, evaporate after a while? Or are they contagious, jumping across regions and bodies, perpetually re-membered from our past shaping our future?

TAPS 1500P - Asian American Theater Making
Course Description: This course frames Asian American theater-making as a dynamic assertion of presence, autonomy and complexity against and beyond a backdrop of cultural, legal and historical exclusion, erasure and assimilation in the United States. In investigating theatrical practices and contexts made about, by and/or for Asian Americans, we explore the in/stability of identity as embodied sites of ambivalence, tension and solidarity. How do Asian American theater artists integrate, reject and transcend the myriad expectations of identity and representation? As scholars and artists, we will read plays, witness and create performances, discuss critical and historical essays and artifacts, and interact with active practitioners across a wide spectrum of Asian American theater-making. Open to advanced undergraduates/graduate students.

TAPS 1751 - Choreodaemonics
Course Description: The phrase “choreodaemonics” is a contraction of “choreography” (the art of bodily movement through space and time creating meaning) and “daemon” (a background computational process). Within this rubric, this seminar seeks to explore the creative opportunities and political risks of creative production through emerging technologies of AI, robotics and virtual presence. Most urgently, "Choreodaemonics" examines the ideological, technological and aesthetic collisions wherever humans collide with emerging computational systems. Students will consider the histories and processes of creative production and technological development, and ultimately investigate the performative consequences of embodiment by computational agents through robots, avatars, games, software, customer service platforms and social media.

UNIV 1111 - Systemic Racism and Modes of Resilience
Course Description: Over the past several years there has been much public discussion about systemic racism, and its role in perpetuating racial inequality. What is systemic racism? What role does it play in society and how have African Americans responded to it? This course will use the lens of “systemic racism” to explore the interconnections between policies and practices that create a network of devastating forms of racial discrimination and disadvantage; conditions that have shifted over time and have made it difficult for black communities, and individuals within them, to flourish. And yet, systemic racism does not have the final word. We will also consider how African-American communities have developed various modes of resilience in cultural, spiritual/religious, artistic, and other facets of life.
